where he either makes
excuses within his mind to be unaffected...

or he finds some way
to trample his guilty sensations.

that there is no justice
nor righteousness in their slavery.

1371
01:43:05,413 --> 01:43:07,705
But you do open up an interesting question.

1372
01:43:08,829 --> 01:43:10,268
What right have you to your niggers,

1373
01:43:10,288 --> 01:43:11,788
when you come down to the point?

1374

- What right?
- Mmm.

1375
01:43:14,038 --> 01:43:16,871
I bought them. I paid for them.

1376
01:43:17,163 --> 01:43:18,954
Of course you did, and the law says

1377
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,913
you have the right to hold a nigger.

1378
01:43:21,038 --> 01:43:22,996
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.

1379
01:43:23,705 --> 01:43:25,747
Suppose they pass a law taking away

1380
01:43:25,829 --> 01:43:27,871
your liberty, making you a slave.

1381
01:43:27,996 --> 01:43:29,080
Suppose.

1382
01:43:29,246 --> 01:43:30,913
That ain't a supposable case.

1383
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,413
Laws change, Epps.

1384
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:34,788
Universal truths are constant.

1385
01:43:34,913 --> 01:43:37,788
It is a fact, a plain and simple fact...

1386

that what is true and right
is true and right for all.

You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

I'm only asking, in the eyes of God,
what is the difference?

climb no higher than brute animals...
