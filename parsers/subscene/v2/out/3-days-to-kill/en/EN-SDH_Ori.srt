1416
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:32,989
Come on, let's go inside.

1417
01:54:34,116 --> 01:54:35,825
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1418
01:54:40,748 --> 01:54:41,831
Come on.

1419
01:54:55,763 --> 01:54:58,723
(♪ THE TEMPER TRAP: "SWEET DISPOSITION")

1420
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,437
Is Dad a badass?

1421
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,277
Well, he's, um...
He's done some things.

1422
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:19,244
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1423
01:55:19,412 --> 01:55:20,912
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1424
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:25,041
He loves you so much.
