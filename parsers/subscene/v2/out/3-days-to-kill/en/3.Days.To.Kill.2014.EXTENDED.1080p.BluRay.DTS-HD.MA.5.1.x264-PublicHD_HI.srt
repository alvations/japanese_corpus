So?

01:54:13,806 --> 01:54:15,308
What's the one word
to make me change my mind?

1411
01:54:15,474 --> 01:54:19,562
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1412
01:54:19,979 --> 01:54:22,273
(CHUCKLES)

1413
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,150
That's two, Ethan.

1414
01:54:24,317 --> 01:54:26,611
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1415
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:27,987
I'm so glad you came!

1416
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:32,992
Come on, let's go inside.

1417
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:35,828
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1418
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:41,834
Come on.

1419
01:54:55,765 --> 01:54:58,726
(I THE TEMPER TRAP: "SWEET DISPOSITION")

1420
01:55:03,022 --> 01:55:04,440
Is Dad a badass?

1421
01:55:06,442 --> 01:55:10,279
Well, he's, um...
He's done some things.

1422
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:19,246
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1423
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:20,915
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1424
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:25,044
He loves you so much.

1425
01:55:55,032 --> 01:56:02,933
