1
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,719
Mr. Director,
this is Agent Vivian Delay.

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,514
For the last ten years,
the Central Intelligence Agency

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,393
has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.

4
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,022
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,858
What we do know is
he's a former German national

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,361
who sells atomic material
to terrorists all over the world.

7
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,115
Intelligence confirms that
a transaction is to take place

8
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,826
next week in Belgrade.

9
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,705
The Wolf's number one man,
the Albino,

10
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,166
will be selling a dirty bomb
to Syrian buyers.

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,754
We've already dispatched
a team to eliminate the buyers,

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,673
secure the bomb,
and apprehend the Albino.

13
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,928
How may I be of service, sir?

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,055
Your target is the Wolf.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,475
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,561
Find him and eliminate him.

17
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,979
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,024
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.

19
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,989
Oh, sir, if I may,

20
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,242
who is our agent on the ground?

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,828
Ethan Renner.

22
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,080
He's a lifer.

23
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,873
He'll get the job done.

24
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,549
The buyers have been neutralized.

25
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,135
Well done, Ethan. Well done.

26
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,803
Going down.

27
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,400
Maid service.
I have your extra towels.

28
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,047
This cold is killing me.

29
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,093
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

30
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,304
- You left a big mess.
- Yeah, well...

31
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,349
...I'm thinking about calling in sick.

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,394
Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.

33
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,538
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:33,795
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with
those little shampoo bottles, I like them.

35
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,633
All teams in position.

36
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,708
Excuse me.

37
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,145
Nice work in there, my man.

38
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,607
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.

39
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,025
I need a second to make a call.

40
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,944
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.

41
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,112
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,948
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,242
Let's see the scan.

44
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:56,915
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and

45
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,836
I don't have any change so
if I could borrow some out of this money.

46
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:03,547
I can come back and I can pay you back.

47
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:06,967
Come on, come on.

48
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:08,385
Son of a bitch.

49
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:11,555
All right, this is worth a lot.

50
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:13,015
I take some of this.

51
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,603
I'm coming back for that.

52
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:33,279
Excuse me.

53
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:36,156
Have we met before?

54
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,953
You would remember me, no?

55
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:49,670
Karachi!

56
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,799
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, Axel!

57
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,676
No one moves on the Albino

58
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:58,887
until we have cleared what's in the box.
Come on.

59
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:03,017
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We met in Karachi last April exactly.

60
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:06,186
But then you were working
as a cocktail waitress

61
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,689
if I remember it correctly?

62
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,947
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.

63
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:18,324
That's a dirty bomb.

64
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,247
Boss.

65
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:27,458
Abort.

66
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,072
- Hey.
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.

67
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,033
You didn't forget, which
means you probably love me.

68
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,451
Of course I do, Zooey.

69
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:06,413
You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday", loudly.

70
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:10,668
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.

71
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,252
You can leave a message
after the beep.

72
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,422
What the f...?

73
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,176
All right.

74
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:27,017
Go, go! Get in position!
Cover me!

75
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,100
Cover Ethan now!

76
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:12,771
We're going in!
We're going in!

77
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:32,541
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!

78
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,666
All right, that's enough.

79
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:09,004
Put it down.

80
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:11,172
Now.

81
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,511
Now slide it over here.

82
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:21,558
I'm not running
after you anymore, fucker.

83
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,818
Ohh...

84
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,224
I see you've read the report.

85
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:06,269
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.

86
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:09,522
It's a type of brain cancer
and it's spread to your lungs.

87
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,566
It doesn't say
how much time I have left.

88
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,654
Three months, possibly five.

89
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:18,990
Yeah.

90
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:26,039
So, no Christmas this year, huh?

91
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,083
I'm afraid not.

92
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,669
I suggest you put your affairs in order.

93
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,838
The CIA thanks you
for your service.

94
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:14,727
What the...?

95
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,711
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?

96
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,631
No, I'm American. I...

97
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,384
- I live here.
- Which floor?

98
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:48,136
No, I mean, I live here.

99
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:51,931
You? You are the owner?

100
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,766
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

101
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,813
Bonjour, mon ami.

102
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:02,859
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.

103
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:04,902
My daughter Sumia is in the kitchen,
she's pregnant.

104
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,572
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.

105
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:09,490
Until they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.

106
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:13,494
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.

107
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:19,333
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.

108
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:21,669
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.

109
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:24,755
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.

110
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:28,134
And it is good that you are finally back.
My name is Jules.

111
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,760
Ethan.

112
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,472
Where's all my stuff?

113
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,434
I also started to paint the room.

114
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,728
My wife think it is best to have
a cheerful color.

115
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:42,315
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.

116
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,109
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.

117
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,119
That's months from now.

118
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,709
Then I guess I need to throw
them out myself.

119
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:04,420
No, no, no, hey, ho.

120
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,178
I'll go to...
Hey! I'll go to jail?

121
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,723
All right, what exactly then
am I supposed to do?

122
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:24,523
Did you really just say that to me?

123
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:32,156
Ethan, Ethan!

124
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,202
I need to talk to your dad.

125
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,871
Psst!

126
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,374
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.

127
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:51,384
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

128
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,556
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.

129
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:02,728
I'm not saying you did,
but I think it's time you and I

130
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,064
got to know each other
just a little better.

131
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:09,568
'Cause you're not just crashing
at some guy's house.

132
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,991
No problem, Ethan.
We will pack and leave now.

133
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:20,371
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?

134
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,208
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.

135
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,710
Sit down.

136
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:38,222
You don't have to go yet,
Jules, at least...

137
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,975
...not until your daughter
has her baby.

138
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,314
But you stay under my rules.

139
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:50,443
- I am also a believer in rules. - Rule
#1, no one steps in this room again.

140
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,988
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.

141
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:55,781
That's right,
you put a bigger sign.

142
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,869
Rule #2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.

143
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:01,996
Yes, of course.

144
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:06,917
And rule #3, you don't
ever paint my room again.

145
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:08,919
- You don't like the color?
- No.

146
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,922
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.

147
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,508
No, yellow is not
a man's color.

148
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:19,805
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.

149
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,725
Like Sumia.

150
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:28,105
OK, OK, no more yellow.

151
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,458
Who is the most
beautiful girl in the world?

152
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,168
- Is that you?
- Look, Daddy!

153
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,461
That is so cute!

154
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,344
Run, run, run!

155
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,859
Hey, salut, Christine.

156
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,694
Hi, you.

157
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,283
Hey.

158
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,669
- This is Christine.
- Hello, Tina. It's me.

159
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,254
I'm in town.

160
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:39,218
I'm in a meeting right now,
so this is not a good time to talk.

161
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:43,931
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.

162
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:47,226
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

163
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:50,062
so, uh... unless it's urgent

164
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,024
I've got some legal stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.

165
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,484
Why?

166
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:00,322
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?

167
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,784
No, not today.

168
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,620
All right, I'll meet you outside.

169
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,415
OK, see ya.

170
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:21,093
Why are we really here, Ethan?

171
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,845
I wanted to see you.

172
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:29,768
And our daughter,
you want to see her too?

173
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,521
Yes. Yes.

174
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,567
I started a college fund.

175
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,569
Why the sudden interest?

176
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:41,989
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.

177
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,991
I left her a message
on her birthday.

178
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:49,580
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.

179
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:51,373
I'm dying, Tina.

180
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,044
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...

181
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:58,923
I'm sick.

182
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,219
I mean, I'm dying.

183
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:07,306
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will

184
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10,726
must be signed
in both French and English.

185
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:18,275
I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.

186
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,992
Come on in.

187
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,003
It's nice.

188
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:41,674
The place looks better than before.

189
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:45,719
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.

190
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:48,514
I know I haven't done right
by you and Zooey.

191
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,018
I want to see her before I go.

192
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,067
You have to make me a promise.

193
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:06,323
I'll let you see her under one condition.

194
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:09,743
Are you done?

195
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:12,997
Are you really done working for them?

196
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:16,083
- Yes.
- Promise me.

197
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:21,130
Yes. I missed a lot.

198
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:28,304
I should have left a long time ago.

199
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:30,180
I'm gonna be fine.

200
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:31,849
I've got the whole day planned.
First...

201
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:34,727
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.

202
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,146
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!

203
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:39,023
Hi.

204
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:44,111
Hi, Zooey.

205
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:48,073
How are you?

206
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:52,328
I'm good, how are you?

207
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:54,288
I'm good, thank you.

208
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,167
- OK.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

209
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,670
No, I'm just... I'll be
back home at 8:30. Yeah?

210
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,297
What are we supposed to do?

211
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,132
All right, how about I cook?

212
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,301
You're on.

213
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:12,723
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?

214
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:15,309
I think I like Dad.

215
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,104
Favorite place to go after school?

216
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,981
I didn't know
we had a favorite place.

217
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,525
Flying chairs, remember?

218
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:26,654
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?

219
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:29,281
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.

220
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,700
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.

221
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,952
Look, I'm not mad at you,
all right?

222
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,665
I don't need you to explain any of this,
all right? It's not a big deal.

223
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:40,417
Come on, Zoe,
let's go to the cafe.

224
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,253
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

225
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,713
Who?

226
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,591
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.

227
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,346
No.

228
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:57,768
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.

229
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:01,438
Sorry, sometimes
I just get a bit nervous

230
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:03,899
when I see American cowboys.

231
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Yee-haw!

232
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:07,861
OK.

233
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:11,782
He's older than you.

234
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,409
Yeah, he's a senior.

235
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:14,743
Is there something wrong with that?

236
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:16,954
Back when I was growing up if you...

237
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:18,789
Hugh is so different than you.

238
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:21,792
Look, I know I'm blowing it here,
Zooey, I...

239
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,836
Look, I...

240
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,754
...thought you might
want to ride this home.

241
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,591
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.

242
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,387
It's... so purple.

243
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,013
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

244
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,432
Right, when I was like nine.

245
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,685
I'm taking the metro with my friends.

246
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,353
All right, so I'll see you
at home for dinner?

247
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,902
Zooey, I'll see you at home for dinner?

248
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,576
- How are these?
- Fresh.

249
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,912
They're fresh?
I just need to steam them, right?

250
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,413
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

251
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,792
Milk?

252
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,835
Only if you plan to fry it.

253
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:50,422
Haven't got that far.

254
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,177
I like a man that doesn't pretend to know
his way around the kitchen.

255
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,763
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.

256
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:58,931
Yes...

257
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,726
...I think I am.

258
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,107
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

259
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,859
thanks to you,
frying it for my daughter.

260
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:14,321
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

261
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:20,869
What did you say your name was?

262
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:23,288
You can call me Vivi.

263
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,250
Nice running into you, Vivi,
but not interested.

264
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,551
Maybe we could talk?

265
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,309
My wife gave me this.

266
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:51,775
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.

267
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,865
All right,
but my bike's coming with me.

268
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,580
The bike's going with me.

269
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,044
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

270
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:13,380
I work for the director of the CIA.

271
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:15,465
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

272
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:17,885
Serbia was my operation.

273
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,386
I was looking for the Wolf.

274
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:22,598
We believe he was
at the hotel that day,

275
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,099
and I believe that
you may have seen him.

276
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:26,351
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet

277
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,229
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.

278
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,612
I want you to come work for me.

279
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,115
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.

280
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:42,534
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around

281
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,037
for more than just
a few measly months?

282
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:51,121
Jesus! That was really close.

283
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,417
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimental drug.

284
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,962
Interested?

285
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,341
This, Ethan, could extend your life.

286
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:10,182
Where's the literature?

287
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,893
You know, the test results.

288
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:19,232
How come no one's told me
about this before?

289
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,943
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.

290
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:25,322
Wow. You make me feel so special.

291
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,116
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?

292
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:33,038
Because you're sick and dead men
have nothing to lose.

293
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:36,416
I have access to many things, Ethan,

294
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:38,710
but only you can give me
access to the Wolf.

295
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,380
I need you to find him...

296
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,548
...and I need you to kill him.

297
00:27:48,221 --> 00:27:51,348
So I buy back my life by killing for you?

298
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:54,601
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.

299
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:56,895
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.

300
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,359
Well, I got a fish to fry and I'm late.

301
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,945
I can get you in home
in time for dinner, Ethan.

302
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:07,656
Question is...

303
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:12,369
...kill or die?

304
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:26,049
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?

305
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,843
Meaning a silencer would...

306
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,846
...be handy.

307
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:34,391
So, how many guys
are we talking about?

308
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,642
One.

309
00:29:05,502 --> 00:29:07,419
Allo?

310
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,284
Grenade!

311
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:17,906
Pretty good for a jobber.

312
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:23,245
You said there'd be one guy,
not five.

313
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:24,830
Oops.

314
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:28,542
But I did say keep the young man
with the mustache alive.

315
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,336
What do you think
this guy looks like?

316
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:33,672
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.

317
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,133
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...

318
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,969
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

319
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,597
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.

320
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,935
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!

321
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,397
Now this...

322
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,902
...is a young man with a mustache.

323
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,279
No, that's a goatee.

324
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,782
That's a mustache and some stubble.

325
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:03,452
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?

326
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,205
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.

327
00:31:06,373 --> 00:31:07,498
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.

328
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,957
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...

329
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,626
What, from your century, grandpa?

330
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:12,169
Look at that, that's a mustache.

331
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,213
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?

332
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:15,839
- Hmm?
- Oh, my...

333
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,716
Who are all these other guys here?

334
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,968
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

335
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:22,388
Nope.

336
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:25,641
Because I usually like to know the person
I'm killing needs to be dead.

337
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:28,018
And that's why you never made it
to the top shelf, my friend.

338
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,514
Goatee, you're up.

339
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,893
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?

340
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,187
I don't know, I swear.

341
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,608
Kill him.

342
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,027
Hold on,
I can get this guy to talk.

343
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,449
He didn't know.

344
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,452
Damn it.

345
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,623
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

346
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,793
I wanna leave my daughter
more than just my shit pension.

347
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,796
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna
cap you to half a dozen kills.

348
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,423
Half a dozen?

349
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,425
I'm already halfway there.

350
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,927
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.

351
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:16,226
Don't take this the wrong way,
Viv, but you're not my type.

352
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,521
I'm everybody's type.

353
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,153
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.

354
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,239
But I am sure that if you don't try it,
you'll be dead in two months.

355
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,162
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

356
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:39,082
And you're giving me credit
for those three guys upstairs.

357
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,420
And I'm also gonna want a...

358
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:47,174
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.

359
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,509
Take it or leave it.

360
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,344
I'll take it.

361
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,890
I like the package.

362
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,977
All right, now do it.

363
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,901
Breathe, Ethan.

364
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,947
It will hit you morphine-quick.

365
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,624
One way or another...

366
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:26,417
...I will make you feel better.

367
00:33:58,108 --> 00:34:00,192
Don't forget to soak the fish.

368
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,868
You promised me my bike.

369
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,085
Zooey!

370
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:26,010
- Zooey! Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

371
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:34,435
Look at this.

372
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:37,605
This looks terrible.

373
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,360
I think your...
Your hair?

374
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:46,322
No, no.
Yes. Yes, my hair.

375
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,116
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

376
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:52,495
It looks, uh, awesome.

377
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:53,871
- Really?
- Yeah.

378
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,581
You think this can go to prom?

379
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:57,708
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.

380
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,336
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?
- No, no, I mean...

381
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:02,421
All these times,
now's the time to say a joke?

382
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:04,048
No, I mean, maybe...

383
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:08,302
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?

384
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,638
No, you can...
You could wash it...

385
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:14,392
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...

386
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,812
It'll be back to normal,
all right? Maybe?

387
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:19,897
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

388
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:21,982
Why don't we
pick up some dinner?

389
00:35:25,612 --> 00:35:29,615
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner
if you're going to be three hours late.

390
00:35:31,785 --> 00:35:34,120
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

391
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:37,498
Save it. I was crazy
to think I could count on you.

392
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,001
I was gonna ask you to look after Zooey
while I go to London for work.

393
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,254
Then, go.

394
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:45,339
Really, you should go,
I can handle it.

395
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:48,342
You can't handle dinner.
How are you gonna handle a teenager?

396
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,180
How about I just diffused
a major meltdown. Her hair, OK?

397
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,810
I have to take the first flight
out tomorrow morning.

398
00:35:57,978 --> 00:35:59,270
I'm calling a sitter.

399
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,067
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.

400
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:08,112
- What?
- There's, um...

401
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,614
There's a specialist here
in Paris who has

402
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:13,492
a experimental drug
she's willing to test on me.

403
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:19,498
Experimental.

404
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,208
What exactly does that mean?

405
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,296
It means I might be able to spend a little
more time with you and Zooey.

406
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:29,925
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.

407
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:37,224
Can we just, like, maybe quit
fighting for a second.

408
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:41,479
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.

409
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:45,649
I could grill us up some of this tuna.

410
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:47,401
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

411
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:49,695
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?

412
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:51,530
No way!

413
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,454
You're gonna fix that door, right?

414
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,664
Oh. Um...

415
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:04,210
Yeah, that was a mistake.

416
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:06,378
You haven't been here 24 hours.

417
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:10,591
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.

418
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:15,554
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

419
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,645
Do you need something
to help you sleep?

420
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:26,398
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

421
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:32,279
You're terrible.

422
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,606
I knew you would call.

423
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,233
What the hell did you give me?

424
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:12,027
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.

425
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:15,406
My head... My head's dizzy.

426
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:17,783
Vivi.

427
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:25,916
- Read the manual.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.

428
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:28,002
I'm hallucinating.

429
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:29,920
- Take a shot of vodka.
- What?

430
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:32,590
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

431
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:17,795
Is everything OK?

432
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,382
Yeah.

433
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:32,643
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.

434
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:38,096
Listen, you can call me
anytime you want.

435
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:40,766
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.

436
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:44,061
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.

437
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:45,854
- I love you.
- All right.

438
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,232
I'll be back in a couple of days,
I'm running late.

439
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,400
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.

440
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,069
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!

441
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:54,029
- Have fun!
- ...for black clothes.

442
00:39:54,197 --> 00:39:56,573
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

443
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:04,248
Look at me. Come on.

444
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:07,626
Just one time up here.
One time.

445
00:40:11,297 --> 00:40:12,381
Atta girl.

446
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:14,591
Zooey!

447
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:22,474
Oh.

448
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:23,850
What?

449
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,019
Wow, it's...

450
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:27,938
- It's what?
- Geez.

451
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,691
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...

452
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:33,694
It's so red.

453
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:35,404
Vivi?

454
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:38,448
Are you going to get that?

455
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:41,410
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.

456
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,704
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?

457
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:47,708
We talk a lot because
we sell internationally.

458
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,168
It's always daytime somewhere.

459
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:53,422
All right, so now we've got
three days to kill.

460
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,673
What are you doing?

461
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,383
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

462
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,051
I'm giving you mine.

463
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,095
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.

464
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:06,852
There. Welcome to this century.

465
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:12,232
Zooey. Zooey.

466
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:16,612
Don't you want to ride
your bike to school?

467
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:20,282
You think Hugh's
gonna like my hair color?

468
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,908
Yes, I do.

469
00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:23,243
- Really?
- Yes.

470
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:26,246
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.

471
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:28,123
So you don't love it?

472
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,416
No.

473
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:31,752
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

474
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,671
Zooey, I really love it.

475
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:37,716
Awesome.

476
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,734
I can see you don't
believe in the customary

477
00:41:55,902 --> 00:41:58,236
forty-eight-hour window between kills.

478
00:41:58,404 --> 00:42:00,864
Well, you only have three days left.

479
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:03,575
I'm not getting into your car, Vivi.

480
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:08,622
Not until I get a second opinion on that
whatever it was you gave me.

481
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,376
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.

482
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:13,960
- Aw.
- The manual says,

483
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:16,088
if you'd bothered to read it,

484
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:18,465
you'd find out if I can't keep
my heart rate lower,

485
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,509
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.

486
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:22,469
So keep your heart rate low.

487
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:25,180
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.

488
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,689
Get in the car already.

489
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:40,234
I need you to locate the Italian accountant

490
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:42,611
who cooks the books
for your old friend the Albino.

491
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:47,908
How am I supposed to locate this guy?

492
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:51,579
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

493
00:42:51,746 --> 00:42:54,456
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.

494
00:42:57,586 --> 00:42:59,920
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.

495
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:01,922
All right.

496
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,591
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?

497
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:05,176
Lose the bike.

498
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,554
- Buy a suit.
- Why?

499
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:11,265
Because I like my boys better-dressed
than the men they kill.

500
00:43:26,526 --> 00:43:30,529
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?

501
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:32,739
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?

502
00:43:32,907 --> 00:43:34,074
An Albino told me.

503
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:39,288
Did he also tell you
that we offer discreet luxury?

504
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:44,418
He told me not to talk to the hired help,
to talk to the boss.

505
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:47,546
We're not the help, OK? We are the
executive vice president of sales.

506
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:49,506
Ooohh!

507
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:51,842
You're a couple of turds.

508
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:02,144
Listen, asshole...

509
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:06,023
...little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.

510
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,025
And you will never meet the boss.
Understand?

511
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:09,192
All right, I'm sorry.

512
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,147
Yeah.

513
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,566
I had a really weird night,
you know,

514
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,860
a couple of weird nights.
Jetlagged.

515
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,279
I think maybe we got
off on the wrong foot. My fault.

516
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,030
Yeah.

517
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,782
Can we start again?

518
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,937
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk

519
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,149
without an invitation, Mr...?

520
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,193
Why are names important right now?

521
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,903
Because I don't want
to kill a total stranger.

522
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,863
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?

523
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,275
You are sitting in my chair.

524
00:45:04,443 --> 00:45:05,902
I'm just waiting for you.

525
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,916
The Albino sent you, huh?
Bastard!

526
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,543
I've always been loyal.
Please...

527
00:45:26,215 --> 00:45:29,342
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!

528
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,304
Sit down.
I also have a pretty teenage daughter.

529
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:36,516
Father to father,
your girls ever

530
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,393
lock themselves in their room,
you know?

531
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:42,480
Cut their hair, paint it red, you know?

532
00:45:42,648 --> 00:45:44,857
Put wigs on and shit like that?

533
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:47,235
No. Never.

534
00:45:48,821 --> 00:45:51,239
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

535
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,704
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.

536
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,167
Then who are you?

537
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:07,880
Ethan. Come on.

538
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,860
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.

539
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:31,529
I do not want to be disturbed.

540
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:35,825
Do whatever you say.

541
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,368
That's right, Rule #2.

542
00:46:37,536 --> 00:46:39,871
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.

543
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:42,081
And you are a good guy?

544
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,298
You are a professional, huh?

545
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:52,758
Why have I never seen you
in Paris before?

546
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:55,094
I've been away on business
for about five years.

547
00:46:55,262 --> 00:46:58,890
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?

548
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:05,688
Well, I was never good
at balancing work and family.

549
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:11,110
You know, when I go home,

550
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:15,448
this life, the killing,
the rest it all disappears.

551
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:19,827
I made the wrong choice leaving.

552
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,791
Everyday I bring my girls to school
and I have dinner with my family.

553
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:26,792
That's the key.

554
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:29,457
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

555
00:47:29,624 --> 00:47:31,667
So let's not miss dinner tonight, hmm?

556
00:47:31,835 --> 00:47:37,256
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?

557
00:47:39,092 --> 00:47:42,136
Please remind me,
who is he again?

558
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:56,357
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.

559
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:58,526
I'd like to have a word with
Zooey's father.

560
00:48:03,157 --> 00:48:04,782
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?

561
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,035
Zooey's fine,
but we need to meet.

562
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:09,996
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.

563
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,666
I can be there right away.

564
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:14,959
Well, do hurry.

565
00:48:19,256 --> 00:48:20,465
We're going to school.

566
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:22,383
As I was saying to Zooey,

567
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,928
study after study has shown that

568
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:29,516
aggression is exacerbated
by violent images in popular culture.

569
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:31,935
Well, Zooey's mother
raised her to be a pacifist.

570
00:48:32,102 --> 00:48:33,269
Hm.

571
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:37,565
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.

572
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:46,449
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?

573
00:48:47,368 --> 00:48:50,578
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,

574
00:48:50,746 --> 00:48:54,123
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...

575
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:56,042
...they all call for different responses.

576
00:48:58,045 --> 00:49:00,380
Mr. Renner, it's extremely important

577
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:03,216
that you send your daughter
a clear message

578
00:49:03,384 --> 00:49:07,053
that no matter what she
has to confront in life

579
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:11,349
violence is not
an acceptable answer.

580
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:12,809
I'll try.

581
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:21,568
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.

582
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:23,444
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

583
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:25,238
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

584
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:28,825
Ow, my thumb.

585
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:30,994
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist

586
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:34,372
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

587
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,959
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?

588
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:44,716
Oh, God.

589
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:52,015
- Are you Muslim?
- No.

590
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:53,725
I told you this is my boss's car.

591
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:56,269
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.

592
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:59,731
- I'm plugging in my phone.
This stuff sucks. - I know.

593
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,485
I like this,
who are these guys?

594
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,614
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
- Let me out!

595
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:11,993
Why can't you just listen to me
and try to understand?

596
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,995
OK, why don't you tell me all about it?

597
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:18,124
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

598
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:21,628
and there's this British girl
who keeps calling her Paki.

599
00:50:21,795 --> 00:50:24,589
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.

600
00:50:24,757 --> 00:50:26,674
Well, she won't do that again, will she?

601
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,806
Just a second, sweetie,
sounds like the spare's loose in the trunk.

602
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:36,267
Hey!

603
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:40,480
I'm trying to have a conversation
with my daughter.

604
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:46,444
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?

605
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:49,822
- Punching the girl, right?
- I feel really bad.

606
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:54,077
Well, don't, because sometimes
it's the only way to stop a bad guy.

607
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:56,954
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

608
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:58,956
I'm proud of you,
you stuck up for your friend.

609
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,751
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

610
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:04,545
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.

611
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:07,840
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.

612
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:11,552
Jesus Christ!

613
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:17,350
Let's see if we can
jump start your memory, Mitat.

614
00:51:26,402 --> 00:51:29,779
It's my daughter.

615
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:32,573
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.

616
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:35,702
That's OK, honey.
I'm sorry, too.

617
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:39,163
Favorite place to hang out after school?

618
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:45,461
I'll wrap my sales meeting
and meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

619
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:50,967
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?

620
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:54,470
A girl like this will keep you
running in circles.

621
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:57,724
You must draw the line,
not be so soft.

622
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,186
You're right, Mitat.

623
00:52:04,273 --> 00:52:05,857
I have been way too soft.

624
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,112
Now, where do I find
the Albino's accountant, hmm?

625
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:26,012
Hi, Zooey.

626
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,223
It's 3:40, Ethan.
Where are you?

627
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:30,475
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

628
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,352
Forget it, you're always late.
I'm leaving.

629
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,813
No, no, no, I'm almost there,
honestly, Zooey.

630
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,439
Give me...

631
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:39,150
Give me five minutes.

632
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:42,070
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.

633
00:53:43,823 --> 00:53:44,906
Wow.

634
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:48,151
Kids.

635
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:18,932
Sorry I freaked out earlier.

636
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,436
It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.

637
00:54:23,604 --> 00:54:26,273
This is really new for both of us.
I get it.

638
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,193
So, favorite place to go after
Flying Chairs, you remember?

639
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:31,611
- I remember.
- Kind of?

640
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:33,280
- Yeah.
- OK.

641
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:36,574
Gosh, the bike.

642
00:55:00,975 --> 00:55:02,600
What's going on, Ethan?

643
00:55:05,146 --> 00:55:07,897
It's just some flu I picked up.

644
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:10,066
Can't seem to shake it off.

645
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:11,359
What if it's something worse?

646
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:14,487
No, it's, uh...

647
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:17,490
It's nothing worse.

648
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:21,870
You remember when we'd drink
hot chocolate at the beach house?

649
00:55:22,038 --> 00:55:23,371
Sort of.

650
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:25,415
It's the one place I wouldn't
mind calling home.

651
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,834
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

652
00:55:29,545 --> 00:55:32,797
You know, I kept all
our home movies in a box.

653
00:55:34,383 --> 00:55:37,677
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?

654
00:55:37,845 --> 00:55:41,014
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Good.

655
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:45,810
Oh, shoot, I forgot.
I have to go to Karina's tonight.

656
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:48,021
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.

657
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:51,691
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.

658
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:54,694
- On a school night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

659
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:57,405
No, it's OK. It's just...

660
00:55:57,573 --> 00:55:59,449
Don't I need to call her parents first?

661
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,534
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

662
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:04,120
That's all her parents understand.

663
00:56:04,288 --> 00:56:05,872
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cool.

664
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,750
I don't need to call your mom.

665
00:56:10,252 --> 00:56:12,420
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

666
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:15,173
See you later.

667
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,220
Hi, this is Christine, I'm not here,
so please leave a message.

668
00:56:20,388 --> 00:56:22,013
Tina, it's me.

669
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:27,060
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs

670
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:31,272
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?

671
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,028
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.

672
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:56,501
Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.

673
00:58:56,669 --> 00:58:58,253
But, uh, who is this friend?

674
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,838
Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.

675
00:59:01,006 --> 00:59:02,507
Anyways, give me a call.

676
00:59:27,283 --> 00:59:28,950
Zooey!

677
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:02,525
Non, non.

678
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,151
Son of a bitch!

679
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:03,294
Is this your car?

680
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,842
Pardon... Is this your car?

681
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,260
- Whoa.
- No.

682
01:01:48,924 --> 01:01:51,801
Hey! You know the rule.

683
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:53,302
Never involve family.

684
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,680
This isn't a business meeting,
Mitat, this is...

685
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:02,353
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.

686
01:02:02,521 --> 01:02:04,105
- It's dinner time.
- Mitat?

687
01:02:10,154 --> 01:02:12,905
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.

688
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:16,993
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.

689
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:25,418
OK. Come, come with us.

690
01:02:25,586 --> 01:02:26,627
Thanks for that.

691
01:02:26,795 --> 01:02:29,172
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

692
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:31,716
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.

693
01:02:31,884 --> 01:02:34,677
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?

694
01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:36,971
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.

695
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:38,723
But your girls might
be able to tell me where

696
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:42,185
a 16-year-old would go
to party on a school night.

697
01:02:43,937 --> 01:02:46,564
What does this "spider" mean?

698
01:02:49,401 --> 01:02:52,236
They are good girls,
they do not party.

699
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:53,863
What does this "spider" mean?

700
01:02:57,367 --> 01:02:58,576
La Soiree House.

701
01:02:58,744 --> 01:03:00,912
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.

702
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:08,377
I have a daughter in there.

703
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:26,807
Zooey.

704
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:28,642
Oui.

705
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:54,168
Zooey!

706
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:09,807
Stop, please, please.

707
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:23,529
Stop, please.

708
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:38,878
Ethan!

709
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:46,218
Ethan! Please!

710
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:10,659
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

711
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:13,746
I got you, honey.

712
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,104
What are you doing here?

713
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,984
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?

714
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:50,950
God, this is so embarrassing.
They'll never let me in there again.

715
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:55,871
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?

716
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,290
Because I like
being with my friends.

717
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,750
Your friends?

718
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:02,211
Do you even remember
what happened?

719
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:06,382
In the bathroom?

720
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:11,387
- Zooey!
- What?

721
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:14,014
In the bathroom,
do you remember what happened?

722
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,767
Look, Karina and I
aced the practice test, OK?

723
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:20,437
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.

724
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:22,815
So we decided to go hang out
with some friends.

725
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,360
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for school.

726
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:29,071
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?

727
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:32,032
You're not going to school today.
Not dressed like that.

728
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:36,495
You're putting this on
and we're going home.

729
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:39,498
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?

730
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:41,709
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.

731
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:44,253
You're getting on this bike and I'm gonna
follow you every step of the way.

732
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:47,589
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.

733
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:50,092
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

734
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,136
Get on this bike.

735
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:54,179
- Or what?
- Now!

736
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:59,852
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, OK?

737
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:11,030
What kind of kid doesn't know
how to ride a bike?

738
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:19,163
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.

739
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:27,087
Goddamn it.

740
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:30,632
This is the flattest spot,
so let's just try it right here.

741
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,593
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?

742
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:36,764
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girl's bike.

743
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:39,141
Right, you picked it
'cause it had the big bow on it.

744
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:43,395
No. I can explain the big bow,
I got it. Get on.

745
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,565
There's too many people.
Look, can we go somewhere private?

746
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:48,400
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.

747
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,320
But it's purple.

748
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:55,824
It is purple. Get on.

749
01:07:55,992 --> 01:07:59,620
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.

750
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,748
Wow, we did it.
We're halfway there. We're on it.

751
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:07,628
Give yourself time to push here, OK?
It's right here then. All right?

752
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:08,921
Zooey, all right.

753
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:10,506
- Whoa. OK?
- OK.

754
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:13,592
- Good.
- Easy, please.

755
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,761
OK, I have you. Now, just
kinda, you know how to pedal.

756
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,097
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?

757
01:08:19,307 --> 01:08:21,183
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

758
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,816
Why did you leave us, Ethan?

759
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:31,527
Why did you leave me and Mom?

760
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:36,407
Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...

761
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:38,283
What?

762
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:41,078
There is no easy...

763
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:45,124
There's no good answer, honey.

764
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:50,295
All right.

765
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:54,258
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

766
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:55,592
Do you have another family?

767
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
- Is that what it is?
- No.

768
01:08:56,928 --> 01:08:58,762
Do you have another
perfect daughter somewhere?

769
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,806
Did you see me and not want me?

770
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:03,392
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

771
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,982
Well, why did it take so long
for you to come back?

772
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:12,526
Look!

773
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:14,278
The longer I was gone...

774
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:17,406
...it felt like the harder
it was to come back.

775
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:30,836
OK, OK, all right.

776
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:36,216
That's all.
It's nothing to do with you.

777
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:41,138
Would you still care about me
if I did horrible things?

778
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:42,598
Yes, of course.

779
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:46,268
Absolutely.

780
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:49,855
I lie a lot.
Like, all the time about everything.

781
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:52,483
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.

782
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:57,571
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.

783
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:01,074
That girl I hit at school,
she wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

784
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:03,160
She was hitting on Hugh.

785
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:05,370
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.

786
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:06,663
Hugh!

787
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:11,168
These are so beautiful, thank you!

788
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,295
Give me one sec, I'll be right back.

789
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:15,672
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

790
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,305
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?

791
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:26,892
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

792
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,937
I'm an athlete.
I'm a striker.

793
01:10:30,104 --> 01:10:32,272
Last game I scored two goals,
by the way.

794
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:36,985
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

795
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,240
No! Well, I...
I... I mean on the field.

796
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,116
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.

797
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:45,869
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

798
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,623
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.

799
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:52,876
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.

800
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:55,087
Real football.

801
01:10:57,465 --> 01:10:58,465
OK.

802
01:11:02,428 --> 01:11:03,679
Nice bike.

803
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:05,639
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.

804
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:07,140
You're the only one.

805
01:11:10,228 --> 01:11:12,854
I won't be home late, Ethan.

806
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:16,358
- Where are you two going?
- School.

807
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:18,569
Great, well,
I'm headed that direction myself.

808
01:11:18,736 --> 01:11:20,070
No, you're not.

809
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:22,281
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.

810
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:24,533
Oh, OK, well, I'm gonna...

811
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:27,160
OK, see you later,
Mr. Zooey.

812
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,539
I don't like being called that.

813
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:31,999
You don't like Hugh?

814
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:35,919
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

815
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:39,631
It's my business to read people.

816
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:42,092
You know, a lot of my friends'
dads are in sales, Ethan,

817
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,803
and not one of them
dresses like you.

818
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:48,015
What are you saying?

819
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:51,268
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.

820
01:11:58,568 --> 01:12:00,485
Hey, I love you!

821
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:07,701
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.

822
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:10,954
The accountant checked out.
I need you to tell me where he is now.

823
01:12:11,122 --> 01:12:13,165
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.

824
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,626
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.

825
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:19,254
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.

826
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:22,466
Is it my fault if your daughter
is out of control

827
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:24,217
and affecting your work and judgment?

828
01:12:24,385 --> 01:12:26,595
You're right, Mitat.
It is affecting my judgment.

829
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:29,014
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.

830
01:12:29,182 --> 01:12:33,310
Hey, my wife works late.
I need to pick up my girls at 4:30.

831
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:35,729
I can't promise,
but I'll make an effort.

832
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,820
Open up.

833
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,407
I can't get around your mirror.

834
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:32,577
Fine, asshole.

835
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,480
Yes!

836
01:14:46,068 --> 01:14:48,069
Ethan! Ethan!

837
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:05,253
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?

838
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:06,505
Yeah.

839
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:12,010
Do not open!
The lock has an explosive trigger.

840
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:16,097
I got the codes to the briefcase.
Give me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

841
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:19,100
But after I give it to you,
you will kill me.

842
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:21,520
No, but I swear to God
I'm gonna really torture you

843
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,522
- if you make me count to three.
- No.

844
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:25,315
- OK, one...
- Oh, no.

845
01:15:25,483 --> 01:15:27,609
- ...two.
- No.

846
01:15:27,777 --> 01:15:30,320
No.

847
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,574
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,

848
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:35,826
I was thinking about tonight.

849
01:15:35,993 --> 01:15:39,704
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...

850
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:45,001
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.

851
01:15:45,169 --> 01:15:47,212
Just the two of you, like a...

852
01:15:49,423 --> 01:15:51,091
- ...romantic dinner?
- Something like that.

853
01:15:51,259 --> 01:15:52,884
And I want to make him
real spaghetti sauce

854
01:15:53,052 --> 01:15:54,719
but I don't know what I need
besides tomatoes.

855
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:56,137
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.

856
01:16:02,019 --> 01:16:03,353
Just a sec, sweetie.

857
01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:06,731
Guido, are you a real Italian?

858
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:10,068
What?

859
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:13,572
I mean, are you a real Italian?
I mean, were you born there?

860
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:16,741
Yes. Catania, Sicily.

861
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:18,910
Could she have a recipe for sauce?

862
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:22,080
Sauce?

863
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:24,207
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.

864
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:27,252
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.

865
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,296
- You just said you're a
real Italian, right? - Si.

866
01:16:29,463 --> 01:16:32,799
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!

867
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:36,636
Ah! Spaghetti sauce!
Red or white?

868
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:42,767
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.

869
01:16:42,935 --> 01:16:44,853
Vegetarian, not too spicy.

870
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:47,188
OK, I know what to tell her.

871
01:16:47,356 --> 01:16:51,526
Sweetie, it just so happens I'm in a
meeting here with a real live Italian.

872
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:53,820
His mama has a great recipe.

873
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:56,823
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.

874
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:59,993
Why don't you say hello
to my daughter.

875
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:03,955
Hello. I am Guido.

876
01:17:04,123 --> 01:17:05,624
Hi, Guido,
this will only take a second.

877
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,791
No, no!

878
01:17:06,959 --> 01:17:09,836
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?

879
01:17:10,004 --> 01:17:12,339
No, no, no.

880
01:17:12,506 --> 01:17:17,052
So, this is my mama's favorite
reduction sauce.

881
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:22,390
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

882
01:17:22,558 --> 01:17:25,602
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

883
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,896
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.

884
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:32,108
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,

885
01:17:32,276 --> 01:17:36,655
and now I am the only one left
to take care of her.

886
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:41,576
What else, Guido?

887
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:48,208
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.

888
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:50,877
Then you peel the tomatoes.

889
01:17:51,045 --> 01:17:53,338
After ten minutes, no more,

890
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:56,633
add capers and parsley.

891
01:17:56,801 --> 01:18:00,845
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

892
01:18:01,013 --> 01:18:03,098
and a teaspoon of sugar.

893
01:18:04,642 --> 01:18:07,894
Boy, that Guido's a real mama's boy, huh?

894
01:18:08,062 --> 01:18:11,147
I think it's sweet that he
loves his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

895
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:15,193
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- OK.

896
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:18,613
No, wait!

897
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:21,116
Oh, please call her back.

898
01:18:21,283 --> 01:18:25,578
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

899
01:18:27,282 --> 01:18:28,658
You know how to tell time?

900
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:31,327
Where's the one?

901
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:34,622
Where's the three?

902
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:37,875
That's two hours.

903
01:18:38,043 --> 01:18:40,419
You cut this guy loose
in two hours.

904
01:18:40,587 --> 01:18:43,881
Guido, remind me where you're going
after this kid lets you go.

905
01:18:44,049 --> 01:18:47,051
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!

906
01:19:06,947 --> 01:19:08,114
You're late.

907
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,742
I'm in the middle
of a training session.

908
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:16,164
Yeah, I... I can see that.

909
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:22,628
Job's done.

910
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:28,342
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

911
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,927
Sit down.

912
01:19:34,892 --> 01:19:37,393
- Champagne?
- No.

913
01:19:38,103 --> 01:19:41,480
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

914
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:43,983
Who doesn't love Paris?

915
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:45,985
Now that we've bankrupted the Albino,

916
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:49,071
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,

917
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:52,116
leading us straight to the Wolf.

918
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:53,868
When?

919
01:19:55,245 --> 01:19:56,704
Very soon.

920
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:23,898
You can't go dressed like that.

921
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:26,943
- What's wrong with how I dress?
- He's seen you

922
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,444
for one thing, Ethan.

923
01:20:28,612 --> 01:20:31,822
You know, it wouldn't kill you to act like
a good spy, maybe try a disguise.

924
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:34,909
Like the Albino, he looks nice.

925
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:37,411
He also has a limp.

926
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:38,871
Want me to try that, too?

927
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:41,749
What are you, cheri, 42 long?

928
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:44,335
Yes.

929
01:20:44,503 --> 01:20:47,630
Good. Take it off.

930
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:17,366
- What's going on?
- Baby.

931
01:21:17,534 --> 01:21:18,743
Baby?

932
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:25,166
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

933
01:21:27,044 --> 01:21:31,005
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.

934
01:22:04,665 --> 01:22:06,290
My God.

935
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:08,250
This is not the first time
for you, after all.

936
01:22:10,128 --> 01:22:11,962
Actually, it is.

937
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:13,589
What about your daughter?

938
01:22:16,009 --> 01:22:18,678
I wasn't there.

939
01:22:18,845 --> 01:22:24,141
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.

940
01:22:27,145 --> 01:22:28,688
You were doing good?

941
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,817
I don't even remember.

942
01:22:37,531 --> 01:22:40,116
The baby is coming!

943
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:48,624
It is a girl.

944
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:02,346
Before the baby leaves the house
for the first time,

945
01:23:02,514 --> 01:23:07,017
it is our custom to have
the family offer a blessing.

946
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,480
- Leave?
- Yes.

947
01:23:11,648 --> 01:23:16,193
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?

948
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:18,904
What word? I mean,
I just I brought Chinese, OK?

949
01:23:19,072 --> 01:23:21,115
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

950
01:23:21,283 --> 01:23:24,744
It's OK.
Everything is as it should be.

951
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:30,541
Look, I didn't mean for you to have
to leave right after the child was born.

952
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:33,335
I mean, there's plenty of room
for everyone.

953
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:36,422
Maybe it's too much room.

954
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:41,427
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.

955
01:23:41,595 --> 01:23:43,512
Just us and the children.

956
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,391
It is good
as long as we are together.

957
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:50,603
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

958
01:23:58,445 --> 01:24:02,323
- It's a boy's name.
- No.

959
01:24:02,491 --> 01:24:05,534
It's the name of a great man
who didn't shoot us when he could.

960
01:24:05,702 --> 01:24:07,661
And instead gave us his home.

961
01:24:07,829 --> 01:24:09,705
She has chosen carefully.

962
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:12,958
The name is perfect.

963
01:25:08,014 --> 01:25:10,391
Hey, how did it go?

964
01:25:10,559 --> 01:25:12,101
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

965
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:14,353
Good.

966
01:25:14,521 --> 01:25:16,480
So dinner was a success.

967
01:25:18,608 --> 01:25:22,194
Wow. You look nice.

968
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:24,738
Did you wear that for me today?

969
01:25:25,814 --> 01:25:27,982
Uh... no.

970
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:30,151
Are you coming to the pre-party tomorrow?

971
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:33,029
Well, I am if you're asking.

972
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:35,197
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

973
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:37,742
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.

974
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:38,743
Yeah.

975
01:25:41,363 --> 01:25:44,907
Don't forget you've got Steelers blood
running through your veins.

976
01:25:50,038 --> 01:25:54,249
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.

977
01:25:54,918 --> 01:25:56,543
So?

978
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:59,213
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

979
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:00,965
So?

980
01:26:01,132 --> 01:26:04,635
So I don't know how to dance
like that, Ethan.

981
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,734
- No.
- Come on.

982
01:26:20,902 --> 01:26:23,278
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.

983
01:26:24,948 --> 01:26:26,740
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.

984
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:29,201
Now, stand on my feet.

985
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:33,205
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.

986
01:26:33,373 --> 01:26:34,999
OK.

987
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:37,960
There and back.

988
01:26:39,713 --> 01:26:42,464
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.

989
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:46,385
Now get off.

990
01:26:56,604 --> 01:27:00,065
Would you wear this suit
tomorrow for me?

991
01:27:01,693 --> 01:27:03,777
Of course I would.

992
01:27:25,832 --> 01:27:27,208
Mom.

993
01:27:33,757 --> 01:27:35,507
Sweetie.

994
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:42,181
You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.

995
01:27:42,349 --> 01:27:44,266
- Yeah.
- Have you told her yet?

996
01:27:45,227 --> 01:27:46,227
No.

997
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:50,231
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.

998
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:55,527
- Just tell her you love her.
- She knows.

999
01:27:56,821 --> 01:27:59,031
She needs to hear it from you.

1000
01:28:00,617 --> 01:28:03,118
Of course I love her.
I mean, I love her the same way...

1001
01:28:05,538 --> 01:28:07,164
...the same way I love you.

1002
01:29:00,385 --> 01:29:01,468
Good morning.

1003
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:03,012
Oh, God.

1004
01:29:04,431 --> 01:29:07,683
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.

1005
01:29:07,851 --> 01:29:09,476
I mean, what's wrong with that?

1006
01:29:11,895 --> 01:29:13,187
What happens when you're gone?

1007
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:23,072
Yeah?

1008
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,408
The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.

1009
01:29:27,911 --> 01:29:28,995
All right.

1010
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,754
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

1011
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:21,047
- Hello.
- You spotted me.

1012
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:24,175
- I'd have to be blind not to.
- Don't do anything stupid, Mitat.

1013
01:30:24,343 --> 01:30:26,219
Your girls are expecting you
home tonight.

1014
01:30:26,386 --> 01:30:28,554
So is your beautiful wife.

1015
01:30:30,766 --> 01:30:32,433
Who were you talking to?

1016
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:53,621
Come on, accelerate!

1017
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:01,045
Come on!

1018
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,355
Come on, faster!

1019
01:32:28,258 --> 01:32:29,508
Have we lost him?

1020
01:32:36,808 --> 01:32:38,851
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.

1021
01:33:15,806 --> 01:33:17,473
Why you don't kill me already?

1022
01:33:19,685 --> 01:33:22,728
Because you're the father who knows best.

1023
01:35:32,275 --> 01:35:33,567
Just kill him!

1024
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:02,930
Vivi...

1025
01:36:42,554 --> 01:36:43,929
Welcome back.

1026
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:59,028
You let the Wolf
slip through your hands again.

1027
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,572
Where am I?

1028
01:37:02,532 --> 01:37:03,866
A safe place.

1029
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:09,239
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.

1030
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:13,076
I was actually pretty curious myself.
And as it turns out,

1031
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:16,288
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.

1032
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:22,669
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
killing for you, Vivi.

1033
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,629
You're almost there, Ethan.

1034
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,175
Kill the Wolf.

1035
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:32,971
I'm gonna need a new suit.

1036
01:37:35,674 --> 01:37:37,342
You heard him.

1037
01:37:44,308 --> 01:37:48,228
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.

1038
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:50,897
Take me to my partner's house.

1039
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,233
He will help me to get out of Paris.

1040
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:59,072
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?

1041
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,115
No!

1042
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:04,994
- Listen, just at least try them on?
- No!

1043
01:38:13,629 --> 01:38:14,629
Whoa!

1044
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:21,886
Just smile and have fun.

1045
01:38:22,054 --> 01:38:25,557
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

1046
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:33,815
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.

1047
01:38:44,034 --> 01:38:46,369
- Zoe.
- Hugh.

1048
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:48,580
- You look great.
- Really, I do?

1049
01:38:48,747 --> 01:38:49,789
Yeah, of course.

1050
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:55,086
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,

1051
01:38:55,569 --> 01:38:56,778
these are my parents.

1052
01:38:56,946 --> 01:38:58,905
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.

1053
01:38:59,073 --> 01:39:00,573
You're welcome.

1054
01:39:00,741 --> 01:39:02,617
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.

1055
01:39:02,785 --> 01:39:04,786
Hi. And this is my partner.

1056
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,750
Pleasure to meet you.

1057
01:39:13,629 --> 01:39:14,796
And you.

1058
01:39:21,804 --> 01:39:22,804
How do you do?

1059
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:26,140
Enchanté.

1060
01:39:30,104 --> 01:39:31,271
Wow.

1061
01:39:42,032 --> 01:39:43,408
Wow.

1062
01:39:44,952 --> 01:39:46,619
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

1063
01:39:59,675 --> 01:40:01,301
Isn't this great?

1064
01:40:01,468 --> 01:40:02,593
Yeah.

1065
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:06,097
Zooey, do me a favor.

1066
01:40:07,266 --> 01:40:09,475
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.

1067
01:40:19,737 --> 01:40:20,737
Cheers.

1068
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,627
You're working again!

1069
01:40:38,505 --> 01:40:41,507
Yeah. There's a problem here.

1070
01:40:43,635 --> 01:40:46,387
That's why you came back to Paris?

1071
01:40:46,555 --> 01:40:49,849
No. I came back to see you and Zooey.

1072
01:40:50,017 --> 01:40:51,642
It was all a lie.

1073
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:54,103
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.

1074
01:40:54,271 --> 01:40:57,315
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

1075
01:40:57,483 --> 01:40:59,650
Right now I don't
have the time to explain.

1076
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,509
The police will be here
in ten minutes.

1077
01:41:27,137 --> 01:41:29,305
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.

1078
01:41:29,473 --> 01:41:31,349
Make sure the street's blocked.

1079
01:41:32,893 --> 01:41:35,019
At least have the decency
to look at me.

1080
01:41:45,322 --> 01:41:46,489
Kill him.

1081
01:41:48,367 --> 01:41:49,367
It's just bad luck.

1082
01:41:58,794 --> 01:42:01,712
Wow, this is unbelievable.

1083
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,965
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.

1084
01:42:14,059 --> 01:42:15,476
I'm gonna be sick.

1085
01:42:16,478 --> 01:42:18,062
Come with me.

1086
01:42:37,082 --> 01:42:38,541
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.

1087
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:40,710
Just please stay here.

1088
01:42:54,845 --> 01:42:56,054
- Zooey!
- What?

1089
01:42:56,222 --> 01:42:57,347
Get down!

1090
01:43:28,045 --> 01:43:29,629
You hear me in there?

1091
01:43:30,923 --> 01:43:32,465
I'm sending you down.

1092
01:44:44,535 --> 01:44:45,952
Oh, shit.

1093
01:45:04,263 --> 01:45:05,263
Don't!

1094
01:45:05,431 --> 01:45:06,931
You never give up, huh?

1095
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:10,935
Yes.

1096
01:45:12,646 --> 01:45:14,439
I gotta...

1097
01:45:36,921 --> 01:45:38,713
Oh, my God.

1098
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:42,550
Am I in hell?

1099
01:45:42,718 --> 01:45:45,553
So that's what it looks like
to you, Ethan.

1100
01:45:45,721 --> 01:45:48,890
Figures.

1101
01:45:50,726 --> 01:45:52,810
- Finish it.
- What?

1102
01:45:55,272 --> 01:45:58,316
Jesus Christ!

1103
01:46:04,907 --> 01:46:06,908
Promise me.
Are you really done working for them?

1104
01:46:08,244 --> 01:46:09,494
- Ethan!
- Ethan.

1105
01:46:09,662 --> 01:46:10,870
It was all a lie.

1106
01:46:11,038 --> 01:46:12,997
Ethan!
Promise you'll never lie to me again.

1107
01:46:13,165 --> 01:46:16,042
Are you really done working for them?
Promise me.

1108
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:18,211
Finish it.

1109
01:46:19,171 --> 01:46:21,047
I don't think so.

1110
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,760
The wife wants me to give it up.

1111
01:47:00,129 --> 01:47:01,379
Can I talk to her?

1112
01:47:01,547 --> 01:47:04,340
No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.

1113
01:47:04,508 --> 01:47:06,884
- What?
- Yeah, we're...

1114
01:47:07,052 --> 01:47:08,720
We're taking a break
from each other right now.

1115
01:47:08,887 --> 01:47:10,930
At least she's not throwing them at me.

1116
01:47:11,098 --> 01:47:13,182
Is everything all right?

1117
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:17,437
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.

1118
01:47:17,604 --> 01:47:19,689
She said things, I've said things.

1119
01:47:19,857 --> 01:47:22,275
There's been some tears,

1120
01:47:22,443 --> 01:47:24,485
but the week overall's
been really worth it.

1121
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:59,020
Hey.

1122
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:02,690
These are some presents
from me and, um...

1123
01:48:02,858 --> 01:48:05,026
...a package that was
dropped at the house.

1124
01:48:05,194 --> 01:48:08,071
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?

1125
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:15,787
I love you, Tina.

1126
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:24,337
If I could say one word to you
to change your mind,

1127
01:48:24,505 --> 01:48:25,922
would you give me that chance?

1128
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:29,133
I've...

1129
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:32,095
I've bungled my whole life, Tina.
I've...

1130
01:48:32,262 --> 01:48:35,556
I've been a terrible husband,
I've done...

1131
01:48:35,724 --> 01:48:38,351
I've done stuff that's
impossible to explain.

1132
01:48:38,519 --> 01:48:43,231
And now I'm about to spend the rest of
my life, whatever I have left, missing you.

1133
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:50,071
I just wanna hang out as long as I can
with my daughter and my wife.

1134
01:48:53,951 --> 01:48:56,744
- What's the word?
- What?

1135
01:48:56,912 --> 01:48:58,413
What's the one word
to make me change my mind?

1136
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:02,667
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1137
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:07,248
That's two, Ethan.

1138
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:09,709
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1139
01:49:09,877 --> 01:49:11,086
I'm so glad you came!

1140
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:16,091
Come on, let's go inside.

1141
01:49:17,218 --> 01:49:18,927
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1142
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:24,933
Come on.

1143
01:49:46,122 --> 01:49:47,539
Is Dad a badass?

1144
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:53,378
Well, he's, um...
He's done some things.

1145
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:02,345
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1146
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,013
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1147
01:50:06,517 --> 01:50:08,143
He loves you so much.

1148
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,132
