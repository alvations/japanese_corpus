1409
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,479
What's the one word to
make me change my mind?

1410
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:19,765
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1411
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:22,439
(CHUCKLES)

1412
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,319
That's two, Ethan.

1413
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,759
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1414
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,200
I'm so glad you came!

1415
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,205
Come on, let's go inside.

1416
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,049
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1417
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,041
Come on.

1418
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,930
(♪ THE TEMPER TRAP "SWEET DISPOSITION")

1419
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,651
Is Dad a badass?

1420
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,486
Well, he's, um... He's
done some things.

1421
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,399
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1422
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,125
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1423
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,250
He loves you so much.

1424
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,241
