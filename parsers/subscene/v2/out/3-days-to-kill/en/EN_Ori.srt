1
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,719
Mr. Director,
this is Agent Vivian Delay.

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,514
For the last ten years,
the CentraI Intelligence Agency

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,393
- has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.

4
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,022
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,858
What we do know is
he's a former German nationaI

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,361
who sells atomic material
to terrorists all over the world.

7
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,115
Intelligence confirms that
a transaction is to take place

8
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,826
next week in Belgrade.

9
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,705
The Wolf's number one man,
the Albino,

10
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,166
will be selling a dirty bomb
to Syrian buyers.

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,754
We've already dispatched
a team to eliminate the buyers,

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,673
secure the bomb,
and apprehend the Albino.

13
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,928
How may I be of service, sir?

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,055
Your target is the Wolf.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,475
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,561
Find him and eliminate him.

17
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,979
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,024
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.

19
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,989
Oh, sir, if I may,

20
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,242
who is our agent on the ground?

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,828
Ethan Renner.

22
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,080
He's a lifer.

23
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,873
He'll get the job done.

24
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,549
The buyers have been neutralized.

25
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,135
Well done, Ethan. Well done.

26
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,803
Going down.

27
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,400
Maid service.
I have your extra towels.

28
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,047
This cold is killing me.

29
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,093
Yeah?
Where are you?

30
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,304
- You left a big mess.
- Yeah, well...

31
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,349
...I'm thinking about calling in sick.

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,394
Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.

33
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,538
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:33,795
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with those
little shampoo bottles, I like them.

35
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,633
All teams in position.

36
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,708
Excuse me.

37
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,145
Nice work in there, my man.

38
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,607
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.

39
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,025
I need a second to make a call.

40
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,944
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.

41
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,112
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,948
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.

43
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,205
Let's see the scan.

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,920
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and

45
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,841
I don't have any change so
if I could borrow some out of this money.

46
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,552
I can come back and I can pay you back.

47
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,972
Come on, come on.

48
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,390
Son of a bitch.

49
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,147
All right, this is worth a lot.

50
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,606
I take some of this.

51
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,029
I'm coming back for that.

52
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,626
Excuse me.

53
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,504
Have we met before?

54
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,301
You would remember me, no?

55
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,018
Karachi!

56
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,147
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, AxeI!

57
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,024
No one moves on the Albino

58
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,235
untiI we have cleared what's in the box.
Come on.

59
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,364
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We met in Karachi last ApriI exactly.

60
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,534
But then you were working
as a cocktaiI waitress

61
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,037
if I remember it correctly?

62
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,295
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.

63
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,671
That's a dirty bomb.

64
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,595
Boss.

65
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,806
Abort.

66
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,419
Hey.
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.

67
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,381
You didn't forget, which
means you probably love me.

68
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,799
Of course I do, Zooey.

69
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,761
You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday," loudly.

70
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,015
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.

71
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,600
You can leave a message
after the beep.

72
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,770
What the f...?

73
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,524
All right.

74
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,365
Go, go! Get in position!
Cover me!

75
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,448
Cover Ethan now!

76
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,119
We're going in!
We're going in!

77
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,889
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!

78
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,980
All right, that's enough.

79
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,190
Put it down.

80
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,318
Put it down.

81
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,486
Now.

82
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,825
Now slide it over here.

83
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,910
You're not going to kill me, are you?

84
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,788
Not unless I have to, all right?

85
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,292
But I'm not running
after you anymore, fucker.

86
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,345
Ohh...

87
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,377
I see you've read the report.

88
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,421
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.

89
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,674
It's a type of brain cancer
and it's spread to your lungs.

90
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,802
It doesn't say
how much time I have left.

91
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,807
Three months, possibly five.

92
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,142
Yeah.

93
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:33,191
So, no Christmas this year, huh?

94
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,235
I'm afraid not.

95
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,697
I suggest you put your affairs in order.

96
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,616
Thank you, doctor.

97
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,744
Well done securing the bomb, Ethan.

98
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,331
But now that you're no longer operationaI,

99
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,085
we need to terminate our relationship.

100
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,678
We've wired your pension into your account.

101
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,431
The CIA thanks you
for your service.

102
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,899
"TROUBLE,
HEARTACHES, AND SADNESS")

103
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,992
What the...?

104
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,977
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?

105
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,896
No, I'm American. I...

106
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,649
- I live here.
- Which floor?

107
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,401
No, I mean, I live here.

108
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:25,196
You? You are the owner?

109
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,031
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

110
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,078
Bonjour, mon ami.

111
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,124
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.

112
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,167
My daughter Sumia is in the kitchen,
she's pregnant.

113
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,837
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.

114
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,755
untiI they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.

115
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,759
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.

116
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,598
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.

117
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,934
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.

118
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,021
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.

119
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,399
And it is good that you are finally back.
My name is Jules.

120
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,026
Ethan.

121
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,738
Where's all my stuff?

122
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,699
I also started to paint the room.

123
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,993
My wife think it is best to have
a cheerfuI color.

124
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,580
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.

125
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,374
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.

126
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,384
That's months from now.

127
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,974
Then I guess I need to throw
them out myself.

128
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,685
No, no, no, hey, ho.

129
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,443
I'll go to...
Hey! I'll go to jaiI?

130
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,988
All right, what exactly then
am I supposed to do?

131
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,789
Did you really just say that to me?

132
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:05,421
Ethan, Ethan!

133
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,467
I need to talk to your dad.

134
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,136
Psst!

135
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,639
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.

136
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:24,649
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

137
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,822
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.

138
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:35,993
I'm not saying you did,
but I think it's time you and I

139
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,329
got to know each other
just a little better.

140
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,834
'Cause you're notjust crashing
at some guy's house.

141
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:48,256
No problem, Ethan.
We will pack and leave now.

142
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,636
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?

143
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,473
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.

144
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,975
Sit down.

145
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,487
You don't have to go yet,
Jules, at least...

146
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,240
...not untiI your daughter
has her baby.

147
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,579
But you stay under my rules.

148
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:23,708
- I am also a believer in rules.
- Rule #1, no one steps in this room again.

149
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,253
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.

150
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,046
That's right,
you put a bigger sign.

151
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,134
Rule #2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.

152
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,261
Yes, of course.

153
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,183
And rule #3, you don't
ever paint my room again.

154
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,185
- You don't like the color?
- No.

155
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,188
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.

156
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,773
No, yellow is not
a man's color.

157
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,070
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.

158
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,990
Like Sumia.

159
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,370
OK, OK, no more yellow.

160
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,723
Who is the most
beautiful girl in the world?

161
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,433
- Is that you?
Look, Daddy!

162
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,726
That is so cute!

163
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,609
Run, run, run!

164
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,124
Hey, salut, Christine.

165
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,960
Hi, you.

166
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,549
Hey.

167
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,934
- This is Christine.
Hello, Tina. It's me.

168
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,519
I'm in town.

169
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,483
I'm in a meeting right now,
so this is not a good time to talk.

170
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,196
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.

171
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,491
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

172
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,327
so, uh... unless it's urgent

173
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,290
I've got some legaI stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.

174
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,749
Why?

175
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,588
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?

176
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,049
No, not today.

177
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,885
All right, I'll meet you outside.

178
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,680
OK, see ya.

179
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,358
Why are we really here, Ethan?

180
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,110
I wanted to see you.

181
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,034
And our daughter,
you want to see her too?

182
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,786
Yes. Yes.

183
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,832
I started a college fund.

184
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,834
Why the sudden interest?

185
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,254
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.

186
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,256
I left her a message
on her birthday.

187
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,845
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.

188
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,639
I'm dying, Tina.

189
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,309
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...

190
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,188
I'm sick.

191
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,484
I mean, I'm dying.

192
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,571
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will

193
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,991
must be signed
in both French and English.

194
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:51,540
I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.

195
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,257
Come on in.

196
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,268
It's nice.

197
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,939
The place looks better than before.

198
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,984
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.

199
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,779
I know I haven't done right
by you and Zooey.

200
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,283
I want to see her before I go.

201
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,332
You have to make me a promise.

202
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,588
I'll let you see her under one condition.

203
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,008
Are you done?

204
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,262
Are you really done working for them?

205
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,348
- Yes.
- Promise me.

206
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,395
Yes. I missed a lot.

207
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,569
I should have left a long time ago.

208
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,446
I'm gonna be fine.

209
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,114
I've got the whole day planned.
First...

210
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,992
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.

211
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,411
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!

212
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,288
Hi.

213
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,376
Hi, Zooey.

214
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,338
How are you?

215
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,593
I'm good, how are you?

216
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,553
I'm good, thank you.

217
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,432
OK.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

218
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,935
No, I'm just... I'll be
back home at 8:30. Yeah?

219
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,562
What are we supposed to do?

220
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,397
All right, how about I cook?

221
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,566
You're on.

222
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,988
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?

223
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:48,574
I think I like Dad.

224
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,369
Favorite place to go after schooI?

225
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,246
I didn't know
we had a favorite place.

226
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,791
Flying chairs, remember?

227
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,919
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?

228
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,546
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.

229
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,965
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.

230
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,218
Look, I'm not mad at you,
all right?

231
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,930
I don't need you to explain any of this,
all right? It's not a big deaI.

232
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,682
Come on, Zoe,
let's go to the cafe.

233
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,519
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

234
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,978
Who?

235
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,856
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.

236
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,611
No.

237
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:31,033
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.

238
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,703
Sorry, sometimes
I just get a bit nervous

239
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,164
when I see American cowboys.

240
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,625
Yee-haw!

241
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,126
OK.

242
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,047
He's older than you.

243
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,674
Yeah, he's a senior.

244
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,008
Is there something wrong with that?

245
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,219
Back when I was growing up if you...

246
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,054
Hugh is so different than you.

247
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,057
Look, I know I'm blowing it here,
Zooey, I...

248
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,101
Look, I...

249
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,019
...thought you might
want to ride this home.

250
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,857
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.

251
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,652
It's... so purple.

252
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,279
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

253
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,697
Right, when I was like nine.

254
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,950
I'm taking the metro with my friends.

255
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,618
All right, so I'll see you
at home for dinner?

256
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,497
"YOUR WISH")

257
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,167
Zooey, I'll see you at home for dinner?

258
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,841
- How are these?
- Fresh.

259
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,177
They're fresh?
I just need to steam them, right?

260
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,678
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

261
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,057
Milk?

262
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:20,100
Only if you plan to fry it.

263
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,687
Haven't got that far.

264
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,442
I like a man that doesn't pretend to know
his way around the kitchen.

265
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,028
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.

266
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,196
Yes...

267
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,991
...I think I am.

268
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,373
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

269
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,124
thanks to you,
frying it for my daughter.

270
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,586
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

271
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,134
What did you say your name was?

272
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,553
You can call me Vivi.

273
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,515
Nice running into you, Vivi,
but not interested.

274
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,816
Maybe we could talk?

275
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,574
My wife gave me this.

276
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,040
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.

277
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,130
All right,
but my bike's coming with me.

278
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,845
The bike's going with me.

279
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,309
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

280
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,645
I work for the director of the CIA.

281
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,731
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

282
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,150
Serbia was my operation.

283
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,651
I was looking for the Wolf.

284
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,863
We believe he was
at the hoteI that day,

285
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,364
and I believe that
you may have seen him.

286
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,616
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet

287
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,494
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.

288
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,877
I want you to come work for me.

289
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,380
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.

290
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,799
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around

291
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,302
for more than just
a few measly months?

292
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,223
Jesus!

293
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,810
That was really close.

294
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,815
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimentaI drug.

295
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,360
Interested?

296
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,739
This, Ethan,
could extend your life.

297
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:46,580
Where's the literature?

298
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,291
You know, the test results.

299
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,631
How come no one's told me
about this before?

300
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,342
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.

301
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,720
Wow. You make me feeI so speciaI.

302
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,515
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?

303
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,436
Because you're sick and dead men
have nothing to lose.

304
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,815
I have access to many things, Ethan,

305
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,109
but only you can give me
access to the Wolf.

306
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,778
I need you to find him...

307
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,863
...and I need you to kill him.

308
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,450
So I buy back my life by killing for you?

309
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,619
When did you become so self-righteous?

310
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,580
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure
that we're talking about the same thing here.

311
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,623
You know, killing.

312
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,298
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.

313
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,050
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.

314
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,848
Well, I got a fish to fry and I'm late.

315
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,433
I can get you in home
in time for dinner, Ethan.

316
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,145
Question is...

317
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,231
...do you want your bike back?

318
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,035
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?

319
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,829
Meaning a silencer would...

320
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,832
...be handy.

321
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,377
So, how many guys
are we talking about?

322
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,628
One.

323
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,007
Knock 'em dead.

324
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,093
Yeah, well, that's the point, isn't it?

325
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,584
Allo?

326
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,448
Grenade!

327
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,071
Pretty good for a jobber.

328
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:11,410
You said there'd be one guy,
not five.

329
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:12,995
Oops.

330
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,707
But I did say keep the young man
with the mustache alive.

331
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,500
What do you think
this guy looks like?

332
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,837
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.

333
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,298
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...

334
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,134
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

335
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,761
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.

336
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,100
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!

337
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,562
Now this...

338
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:43,066
...is a young man with a mustache.

339
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,444
No, that's a goatee.

340
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:47,946
That's a mustache and some stubble.

341
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,616
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?

342
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,369
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.

343
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,662
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.

344
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,122
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...

345
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,790
What, from your century, grandpa?

346
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,334
Look at that, that's a mustache.

347
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,377
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?

348
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,004
- Hmm?
- Oh, my...

349
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,881
Who are all these other guys here?

350
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,133
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

351
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,552
Nope.

352
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,805
Because I usually like to know the person
I'm killing needs to be dead.

353
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,183
And that's why you never made it
to the top shelf, my friend.

354
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,685
Goatee, you're up.

355
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,064
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?

356
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,357
I don't know, I swear.

357
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,779
Kill him.

358
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,198
Hold on,
I can get this guy to talk.

359
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,620
He didn't know.

360
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,873
Goddamn it.

361
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,834
Do you even have a line
that can't be crossed?

362
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,635
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

363
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,805
I wanna leave my daughter
more than just my shit pension.

364
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,808
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna cap you
to half a dozen kills.

365
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,434
Half a dozen?

366
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,436
I'm already halfway there.

367
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,939
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.

368
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,238
Don't take this the wrong way,
Viv, but you're not my type.

369
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,533
I'm everybody's type.

370
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,164
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.

371
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,251
But I am sure that if you don't try it,
you'll be dead in two months.

372
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,173
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

373
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,094
And you're giving me credit
for those three guys upstairs.

374
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,431
And I'm also gonna want a...

375
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,185
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.

376
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,521
Take it or leave it.

377
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,356
I'll take it.

378
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:49,901
I like the package.

379
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,989
All right, now do it.

380
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,912
Breathe, Ethan.

381
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,959
It will hit you morphine-quick.

382
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,635
One way or another...

383
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:21,433
...I will make you feeI better.

384
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,007
Don't forget to soak the fish.

385
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,682
You promised me my bike.

386
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Zooey!

387
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,824
- Zooey! Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

388
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,748
"KILL ME")

389
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,250
Look at this.

390
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,419
This looks terrible.

391
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,174
I think your...
Your hair?

392
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,136
No, no.
Yes. Yes, my hair.

393
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,931
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

394
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,309
It looks, uh, awesome.

395
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,686
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,396
You think this can go to prom?

397
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:51,523
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.

398
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,150
- Oh, is that some kind ofjoke?
- No, no, I mean...

399
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,236
All these times,
now's the time to say a joke?

400
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,862
No, I mean, maybe...

401
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,117
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?

402
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,452
No, you can...
You could wash it...

403
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,206
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...

404
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,626
It'll be back to normaI,
all right? Maybe?

405
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,712
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

406
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,797
Why don't we
pick up some dinner?

407
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,430
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner
if you're going to be three hours late.

408
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,934
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

409
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,313
Save it. I was crazy
to think I could count on you.

410
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,816
I was gonna ask you to look after Zooey
while I go to London for work.

411
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,068
Then, go.

412
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,154
Really, you should go,
I can handle it.

413
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,157
You can't handle dinner.
How are you gonna handle a teenager?

414
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:46,995
How about I just diffused
a major meltdown. Her hair, OK?

415
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,624
I have to take the first flight
out tomorrow morning.

416
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,084
I'm calling a sitter.

417
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,882
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.

418
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,926
- What?
- There's, um...

419
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,429
There's a specialist here
in Paris who has

420
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,307
a experimentaI drug
she's willing to test on me.

421
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,313
ExperimentaI.

422
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,023
What exactly does that mean?

423
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:19,110
It means I might be able to spend a little
more time with you and Zooey.

424
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,740
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.

425
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,039
Can we just, like, maybe quit
fighting for a second.

426
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,293
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.

427
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:39,464
I could grill us up some of this tuna.

428
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,216
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

429
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,510
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?

430
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,345
No way!

431
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,268
You're gonna fix that door, right?

432
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,479
Oh. Um...

433
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,024
Yeah, that was a mistake.

434
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,193
You haven't been here 24 hours.

435
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,406
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.

436
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:09,369
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

437
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,459
Do you need something
to help you sleep?

438
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,213
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

439
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,094
You're terrible.

440
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,421
I knew you would call.

441
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,047
What the hell did you give me?

442
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,842
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.

443
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,220
My head... My head's dizzy.

444
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,598
Vivi.

445
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:19,731
- Read the manuaI.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.

446
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,816
I'm hallucinating.

447
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,735
- Take a shot of vodka.
- What?

448
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,404
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

449
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,327
Is everything OK?

450
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,872
Yeah.

451
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,090
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.

452
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,554
Listen, you can call me
anytime you want.

453
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,223
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.

454
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,518
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.

455
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,311
- I love you.
All right.

456
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,689
I'll be back in a couple of days,
I'm running late.

457
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:44,857
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.

458
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,526
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!

459
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,486
- Have fun!
- ... for black clothes.

460
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,030
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

461
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:58,705
Look at me. Come on.

462
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:02,083
Just one time up here.
One time.

463
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,838
Atta girl.

464
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,048
Zooey!

465
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,931
Oh.

466
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,308
What?

467
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,476
Wow, it's...

468
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,395
- It's what?
- Geez.

469
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,148
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...

470
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,151
It's so red.

471
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,861
Vivi?

472
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,905
Are you going to get that?

473
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,867
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.

474
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,161
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?

475
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,165
We talk a lot because
we sell internationally.

476
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,626
It's always daytime somewhere.

477
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,879
All right, so now we've got
three days to kill.

478
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,130
What are you doing?

479
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,840
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

480
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,508
I'm giving you mine.

481
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,552
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.

482
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,805
"I LOVE IT")

483
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,309
There. Welcome to this century.

484
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:06,689
Zooey. Zooey.

485
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,069
Don't you want to ride
your bike to schooI?

486
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,739
You think Hugh's
gonna like my hair color?

487
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,366
Yes, I do.

488
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,700
- Really?
- Yes.

489
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,703
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.

490
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,580
So you don't love it?

491
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,873
No.

492
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,209
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

493
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,128
Zooey, I really love it.

494
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,173
Awesome.

495
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,191
I can see you don't
believe in the customary

496
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,694
forty-eight-hour window between kills.

497
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,321
Well, you only have three days left.

498
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,032
I'm not getting into your car, Vivi.

499
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,079
Not untiI I get a second opinion on that
whatever it was you gave me.

500
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,833
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.

501
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,418
- Aw.
- The manuaI says,

502
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,545
if you'd bothered to read it,

503
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,922
you'd find out if I can't keep
my heart rate lower,

504
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,966
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.

505
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,926
So keep your heart rate low.

506
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,637
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.

507
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,146
Get in the car already.

508
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,694
I need you to locate
the Italian accountant

509
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,071
who cooks the books
for your old friend the Albino.

510
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:42,368
How am I supposed to locate this guy?

511
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:46,038
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

512
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,916
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.

513
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:54,380
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.

514
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,382
All right.

515
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,050
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?

516
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,635
Lose the bike.

517
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,930
- Buy a suit.
- Why?

518
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,907
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?

519
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:23,117
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?

520
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,452
An Albino told me.

521
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,665
Did he also tell you
that we offer discreet luxury?

522
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,795
He told me not to talk to the hired help,
to talk to the boss.

523
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,924
We're not the help, OK?
We are the executive vice president of sales.

524
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:39,884
Ooohh!

525
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:42,220
You're a couple of turds.

526
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,522
Listen, asshole...

527
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:56,400
...little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.

528
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,402
And you will never meet the boss.
Understand?

529
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,570
All right, I'm sorry.

530
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:00,530
Yeah.

531
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,949
I had a really weird night,
you know,

532
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:05,243
a couple ofweird nights.
Jetlagged.

533
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,662
I think maybe we got
off on the wrong foot. My fault.

534
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:09,413
Yeah.

535
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,165
Can we start again?

536
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,461
Let's start again.

537
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,005
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think
you can see the EiffeI Tower from

538
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,715
everywhere in this town.

539
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:55,126
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk

540
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,337
without an invitation, Mr...?

541
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,339
Why are names important right now?

542
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,049
Because I don't want
to kill a totaI stranger.

543
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,010
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?

544
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,431
You are sitting in my chair.

545
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:10,057
I'm just waiting for you.

546
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,071
The Albino sent you, huh?
Bastard!

547
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,699
I've always been loyaI.
Please...

548
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,497
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!

549
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,460
Sit down.
I also have a pretty teenage daughter.

550
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:40,671
Father to father,
your girls ever

551
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,549
lock themselves in their room,
you know?

552
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,635
Cut their hair, paint it red, you know?

553
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,013
Put wigs on and shit like that?

554
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,390
No. Never.

555
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,394
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

556
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,860
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.

557
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,323
Then who are you?

558
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,036
Ethan. Come on.

559
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,122
"SOUL SEARCHING" PLAYS)

560
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:33,015
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.

561
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,684
I do not want to be disturbed.

562
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:39,980
Yes. Rule #2:
Do whatever you say.

563
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,524
That's right, Rule #2.

564
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:44,026
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.

565
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,237
And you are a good guy?

566
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,453
You are a professionaI, huh?

567
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,914
Why have I never seen you
in Paris before?

568
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,250
I've been away on business
for about five years.

569
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:03,045
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?

570
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,844
Well, I was never good
at balancing work and family.

571
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,266
You know, when I go home,

572
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,603
this life, the killing,
the rest it all disappears.

573
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,983
I made the wrong choice leaving.

574
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,947
Everyday I bring my girls to schooI
and I have dinner with my family.

575
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:30,948
That's the key.

576
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,617
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

577
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,828
So let's not miss dinner tonight, hmm?

578
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:41,417
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?

579
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,297
Please remind me,
who is he again?

580
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,519
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. DriskaI here.

581
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,688
I'd like to have a word with
Zooey's father.

582
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,944
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?

583
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,197
Zooey's fine,
but we need to meet.

584
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:14,158
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.

585
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:17,828
I can be there right away.

586
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,121
Well, do hurry.

587
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,627
We're going to schooI.

588
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,545
As I was saying to Zooey,

589
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,089
study after study has shown that

590
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:33,677
aggression is exacerbated
by violent images in popular culture.

591
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,096
Well, Zooey's mother
raised her to be a pacifist.

592
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,431
Hm.

593
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,727
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.

594
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,611
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?

595
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,740
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,

596
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,285
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...

597
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,204
...they all call for different responses.

598
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,542
Mr. Renner, it's extremely important

599
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:07,378
that you send your daughter
a clear message

600
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,215
that no matter what she
has to confront in life

601
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:15,511
violence is not
an acceptable answer.

602
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,971
I'll try.

603
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,729
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.

604
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,606
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

605
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,400
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

606
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,987
Ow, my thumb.

607
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:35,155
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist

608
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:38,534
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

609
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,121
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?

610
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:48,877
Oh, God.

611
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,176
- Are you Muslim?
- No.

612
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,886
I told you this is my boss's car.

613
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,431
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.

614
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,892
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.
- I know.

615
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,644
"KILL ME")

616
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,647
I like this,
who are these guys?

617
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,775
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
Let me out!

618
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:16,155
Why can't you just listen to me
and try to understand?

619
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,157
OK, why don't you tell me all about it?

620
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,286
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

621
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,789
and there's this British girI
who keeps calling her Paki.

622
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,751
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.

623
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:30,836
Well, she won't do that again, will she?

624
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,968
Just a second, sweetie,
sounds like the spare's loose in the trunk.

625
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,429
Hey!

626
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,642
I'm trying to have a conversation
with my daughter.

627
00:51:47,228 --> 00:51:50,606
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?

628
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,984
- Punching the girI, right?
- I feeI really bad.

629
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:58,238
Well, don't, because sometimes
it's the only way to stop a bad guy.

630
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,116
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

631
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,118
I'm proud of you,
you stuck up for your friend.

632
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,913
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

633
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,707
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.

634
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,002
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.

635
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,714
Jesus Christ!

636
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,512
Let's see ifwe can
jump start your memory, Mitat.

637
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:33,941
It's my daughter.

638
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,735
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.

639
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,863
That's OK, honey.
I'm sorry, too.

640
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,325
Favorite place to hang out after schooI?

641
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:49,623
I'll wrap my sales meeting
and meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

642
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,129
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?

643
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,632
A girl like this will keep you
running in circles.

644
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,885
You must draw the line,
not be so soft.

645
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,348
You're right, Mitat.

646
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,018
I have been way too soft.

647
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,274
Now, where do I find
the Albino's accountant, hmm?

648
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,137
Hi, Zooey.

649
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,348
It's 3:40, Ethan.
Where are you?

650
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,600
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

651
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,477
Forget it, you're always late.
I'm leaving.

652
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,938
No, no, no, I'm almost there,
honestly, Zooey.

653
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,564
Give me...

654
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,275
Give me five minutes.

655
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,195
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.

656
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,031
Wow.

657
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,284
Kids.

658
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,120
"LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT")

659
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,065
Sorry I freaked out earlier.

660
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:24,570
It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.

661
00:55:24,737 --> 00:55:27,406
This is really new for both of us.
I get it.

662
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,326
So, favorite place to go after Flying Chairs,
you remember?

663
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,744
- I remember.
- Kind of?

664
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,413
- Yeah.
- OK.

665
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,708
Gosh, the bike.

666
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,734
What's going on, Ethan?

667
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,031
It's just some flu I picked up.

668
00:56:09,198 --> 00:56:11,199
Can't seem to shake it off.

669
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,492
What if it's something worse?

670
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,621
No, it's, uh...

671
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:18,624
It's nothing worse.

672
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,003
You remember when we'd drink
hot chocolate at the beach house?

673
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,504
Sort of.

674
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,548
It's the one place I wouldn't
mind calling home.

675
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,967
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

676
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,930
You know, I kept all
our home movies in a box.

677
00:56:35,516 --> 00:56:38,810
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?

678
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,147
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Good.

679
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,943
Oh, shoot, I forgot.
I have to go to Karina's tonight.

680
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,154
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.

681
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,824
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.

682
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,827
- On a schooI night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

683
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,538
No, it's OK. It's just...

684
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,582
Don't I need to call her parents first?

685
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,668
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

686
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:05,253
That's all her parents understand.

687
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,005
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cooI.

688
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,883
I don't need to call your mom.

689
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,553
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

690
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,306
See you later.

691
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,353
Hi, this is Christine, I'm not here,
so please leave a message.

692
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,146
Tina, it's me.

693
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:28,193
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs

694
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:32,406
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?

695
00:57:32,573 --> 00:57:38,161
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.

696
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,634
Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.

697
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,386
But, uh, who is this friend?

698
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,972
Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.

699
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:03,640
Anyways, give me a call.

700
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,083
Zooey!

701
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,658
Non, non.

702
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,284
Son of a bitch!

703
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,427
Is this your car?

704
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,976
Pardon... Is this your car?

705
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:12,394
- Whoa.
- No.

706
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,934
Hey! You know the rule.

707
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,436
Never involve family.

708
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:56,813
This isn't a business meeting,
Mitat, this is...

709
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:03,486
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.

710
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,238
- It's dinner time.
Mitat?

711
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,039
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.

712
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,126
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.

713
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,551
OK. Come, come with us.

714
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,761
Thanks for that.

715
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,305
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

716
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,849
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.

717
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,810
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?

718
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,104
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.

719
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,856
But your girls might
be able to tell me where

720
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:43,318
a 16-year-old would go
to party on a schooI night.

721
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,697
What does this "spider" mean?

722
01:03:50,534 --> 01:03:53,369
They are good girls,
they do not party.

723
01:03:53,537 --> 01:03:54,996
What does this "spider" mean?

724
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,709
La Soiree House.

725
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,045
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.

726
01:04:06,258 --> 01:04:09,511
I have a daughter in there.

727
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,946
Zooey.

728
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,697
Oui.

729
01:04:54,306 --> 01:04:55,306
Zooey!

730
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:10,947
Stop, please, please.

731
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,669
Stop, please.

732
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,471
Ethan!

733
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,018
Ethan!

734
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,358
Ethan! Please!

735
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,799
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

736
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:14,886
I got you, honey.

737
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,245
What are you doing here?

738
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:45,124
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?

739
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:52,090
God, this is so embarrassing.
They'll never let me in there again.

740
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,011
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?

741
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,430
Because I like
being with my friends.

742
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,890
Your friends?

743
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,351
Do you even remember
what happened?

744
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,522
In the bathroom?

745
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,527
- Zooey!
- What?

746
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,154
In the bathroom,
do you remember what happened?

747
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,907
Look, Karina and I
aced the practice test, OK?

748
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,577
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.

749
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:23,955
So we decided to go hang out
with some friends.

750
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,500
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for schooI.

751
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:30,211
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?

752
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,172
You're not going to schooI today.
Not dressed like that.

753
01:07:34,466 --> 01:07:37,635
You're putting this on and we're going home.

754
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,638
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?

755
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,849
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.

756
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,393
You're getting on this bike and I'm gonna
follow you every step of the way.

757
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,730
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.

758
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:51,232
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

759
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,276
Get on this bike.

760
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,320
- Or what?
- Now!

761
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,992
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, OK?

762
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,170
What kind of kid doesn't know
how to ride a bike?

763
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:20,303
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.

764
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,227
Goddamn it.

765
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:31,773
This is the flattest spot,
so let's just try it right here.

766
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,733
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?

767
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:37,904
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girI's bike.

768
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,281
Right, you picked it
'cause it had the big bow on it.

769
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,535
No. I can explain the big bow,
I got it. Get on.

770
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:47,705
There's too many people.
Look, can we go somewhere private?

771
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,540
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.

772
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,460
But it's purple.

773
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,964
It is purple. Get on.

774
01:08:57,132 --> 01:09:00,760
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.

775
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,888
Wow, we did it.
We're halfway there. We're on it.

776
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,768
Give yourself time to push here, OK?
It's right here then. All right?

777
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,061
Zooey, all right.

778
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,646
- Whoa. OK?
- OK.

779
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,732
- Good.
- Easy, please.

780
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,901
OK, I have you. Now, just
kinda, you know how to pedaI.

781
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,237
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?

782
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:22,323
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

783
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,956
Why did you leave us, Ethan?

784
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:32,667
Why did you leave me and Mom?

785
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,547
Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...

786
01:09:37,714 --> 01:09:39,424
What?

787
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,218
There is no easy...

788
01:09:44,596 --> 01:09:46,264
There's no good answer, honey.

789
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,436
All right.

790
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:55,398
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

791
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,732
Do you have another family?

792
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,900
- Is that what it is?
No.

793
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,902
Do you have another
perfect daughter somewhere?

794
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,946
Did you see me and not want me?

795
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:04,532
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

796
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,122
Well, why did it take so long
for you to come back?

797
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,666
Look!

798
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,418
The longer I was gone...

799
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,546
...it felt like the harder
it was to come back.

800
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,976
OK, OK, all right.

801
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:37,356
That's all.
It's nothing to do with you.

802
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:42,278
Would you still care about me
if I did horrible things?

803
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:43,738
Yes, of course.

804
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,408
Absolutely.

805
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,995
I lie a lot.
Like, all the time about everything.

806
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:53,623
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.

807
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:58,711
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.

808
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:02,215
That girI I hit at schooI,
she wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

809
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:04,300
She was hitting on Hugh.

810
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,511
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.

811
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:07,803
Hugh!

812
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:12,308
These are so beautifuI, thank you!

813
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:14,435
Give me one sec, I'll be right back.

814
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,812
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

815
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,445
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?

816
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:28,032
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

817
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,077
I'm an athlete.
I'm a striker.

818
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,412
Last game I scored two goals,
by the way.

819
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:38,125
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

820
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,380
No! Well, I...
I... I mean on the field.

821
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,257
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.

822
01:11:44,424 --> 01:11:47,009
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

823
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:50,763
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.

824
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:54,016
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.

825
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:56,227
ReaI football.

826
01:11:58,605 --> 01:11:59,605
OK.

827
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,819
Nice bike.

828
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,779
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.

829
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,281
You're the only one.

830
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,995
I won't be home late, Ethan.

831
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:17,498
- Where are you two going?
- SchooI.

832
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,709
Great, well,
I'm headed that direction myself.

833
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:21,210
No, you're not.

834
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,421
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.

835
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,673
Oh, OK, well, I'm gonna...

836
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,301
OK, see you later,
Mr. Zooey.

837
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,679
I don't like being called that.

838
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,139
You don't like Hugh?

839
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:37,059
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

840
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:40,771
It's my business to read people.

841
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,232
You know, a lot of my friends'
dads are in sales, Ethan,

842
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,943
and not one of them
dresses like you.

843
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:49,155
What are you saying?

844
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,408
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.

845
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,626
Hey, I love you!

846
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:08,841
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.

847
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,094
The accountant checked out.
I need you to tell me where he is now.

848
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,305
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.

849
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,766
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.

850
01:13:16,933 --> 01:13:20,394
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.

851
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,606
Is it my fault if your daughter
is out of controI

852
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,358
and affecting your work and judgment?

853
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:27,735
You're right, Mitat.
It is affecting my judgment.

854
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,154
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.

855
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:34,450
Hey, my wife works late.
I need to pick up my girls at 4:30.

856
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,869
I can't promise,
but I'll make an effort.

857
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,960
Open up.

858
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,547
I can't get around your mirror.

859
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:33,718
Fine, asshole.

860
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,620
Yes!

861
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,210
Ethan! Ethan!

862
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:06,393
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?

863
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:07,645
Yeah.

864
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:13,150
Do not open!
The lock has an explosive trigger.

865
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:17,238
I got the codes to the briefcase.
Give me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

866
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:20,241
But after I give it to you,
you will kill me.

867
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:22,660
No, but I swear to God
I'm gonna really torture you

868
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,662
- if you make me count to three.
- No.

869
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,455
- OK, one...
- Oh, no.

870
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,749
- ... two
- No.

871
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,460
No.

872
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,714
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,

873
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:36,966
I was thinking about tonight.

874
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:40,845
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...

875
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:46,141
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.

876
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:48,352
Just the two of you, like a...

877
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,231
- ... romantic dinner?
- Something like that.

878
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,024
And I want to make him
reaI spaghetti sauce

879
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,860
but I don't know what I need
besides tomatoes.

880
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:57,278
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.

881
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,493
Just a sec, sweetie.

882
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,872
Guido, are you a reaI Italian?

883
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,208
What?

884
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:14,712
I mean, are you a reaI Italian?
I mean, were you born there?

885
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,882
Yes. Catania, Sicily.

886
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:20,050
Could she have a recipe for sauce?

887
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,220
Sauce?

888
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,347
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.

889
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:28,392
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.

890
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,436
- You just said you're a reaI Italian, right?
- Si.

891
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:33,939
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!

892
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:37,776
Ah! Spaghetti sauce!
Red or white?

893
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,908
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.

894
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:45,993
Vegetarian, not too spicy.

895
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,329
OK, I know what to tell her.

896
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:52,666
Sweetie, itjust so happens I'm in a meeting
here with a reaI live Italian.

897
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,960
His mama has a great recipe.

898
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,963
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.

899
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:01,133
Why don't you say hello
to my daughter.

900
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:05,095
Hello. I am Guido.

901
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,764
Hi, Guido,
this will only take a second.

902
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:07,932
No, no!

903
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:10,976
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?

904
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:13,479
No, no, no.

905
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:18,192
So, this is my mama's favorite
reduction sauce.

906
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:23,530
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

907
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:26,742
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

908
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,036
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cooI.

909
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:33,248
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to schooI,

910
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:37,795
and now I am the only one left
to take care of her.

911
01:18:41,424 --> 01:18:42,716
What else, Guido?

912
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:49,348
Heat the olive oiI,
crush the garlic.

913
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:52,017
Then you peeI the tomatoes.

914
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:54,478
After ten minutes, no more,

915
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:57,773
add capers and parsley.

916
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:01,986
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

917
01:19:02,153 --> 01:19:04,238
and a teaspoon of sugar.

918
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:09,034
Boy, that Guido's a reaI mama's boy, huh?

919
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:12,287
I think it's sweet that he
loves his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

920
01:19:12,455 --> 01:19:16,333
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- OK.

921
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,753
No, wait!

922
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,256
Oh, please call her back.

923
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:26,719
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

924
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,805
You know how to tell time?

925
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:32,474
Where's the one?

926
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:35,769
Where's the three?

927
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,022
That's two hours.

928
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,567
You cut this guy loose
in two hours.

929
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:45,028
Guido, remind me where you're going
after this kid lets you go.

930
01:19:45,196 --> 01:19:48,198
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!

931
01:20:26,362 --> 01:20:28,071
You're late.

932
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,367
I'm in the middle
of a training session.

933
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,789
Yeah, I... I can see that.

934
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:47,674
Job's done.

935
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:53,388
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

936
01:20:53,556 --> 01:20:54,973
Sit down.

937
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:57,935
Or did you forget why you came?

938
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:06,276
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.

939
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:11,114
You're just an American girI having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

940
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:13,325
Who doesn't love Paris?

941
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:15,285
Now that we've bankrupted the Albino,

942
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:18,372
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,

943
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,416
leading us straight to the Wolf.

944
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:23,168
When?

945
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,004
Very soon.

946
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,967
You can't go dressed like that.

947
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:19,641
What's wrong with how I dress?

948
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:22,519
What are you, cheri, 42 long?

949
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:25,105
Yes.

950
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,441
- Take it off.
- Excuse me?

951
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,236
Shoes, everything. Let's go.

952
01:22:53,676 --> 01:22:56,553
- What's going on?
- Baby.

953
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:57,930
Baby?

954
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:04,353
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

955
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:10,192
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.

956
01:23:43,851 --> 01:23:45,477
My God.

957
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,437
This is not the first time
for you, after all.

958
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:51,149
Actually, it is.

959
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:52,776
What about your daughter?

960
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,864
I wasn't there.

961
01:23:58,032 --> 01:24:03,328
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.

962
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,874
You were doing good?

963
01:24:10,586 --> 01:24:12,004
I don't even remember.

964
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,302
The baby is coming!

965
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,811
It is a girI.

966
01:24:38,781 --> 01:24:41,533
Before the baby leaves the house
for the first time,

967
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:46,204
it is our custom to have
the family offer a blessing.

968
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,667
- Leave?
- Yes.

969
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:55,380
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?

970
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:58,091
What word? I mean,
I just I brought Chinese, OK?

971
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,302
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

972
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,930
It's OK.
Everything is as it should be.

973
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,728
Look, I didn't mean for you to have
to leave right after the child was born.

974
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:12,522
I mean, there's plenty of room
for everyone.

975
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,609
Maybe it's too much room.

976
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:20,614
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.

977
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,699
Just us and the children.

978
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:26,578
It is good
as long as we are together.

979
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:29,790
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

980
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,510
- It's a boy's name.
- No.

981
01:25:41,677 --> 01:25:44,721
It's the name of a great man
who didn't shoot us when he could.

982
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,848
And instead gave us his home.

983
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,892
She has chosen carefully.

984
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,145
The name is perfect.

985
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:49,578
Hey, how did it go?

986
01:26:49,745 --> 01:26:51,288
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

987
01:26:51,455 --> 01:26:53,540
Good.

988
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:55,667
So dinner was a success.

989
01:26:57,795 --> 01:27:01,381
Wow. You look nice.

990
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:03,925
Did you wear that for me today?

991
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,388
Uh... no. I had to...

992
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:09,931
I had to give a speech.

993
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:12,100
Are you coming to the pre-party tomorrow?

994
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:14,978
Well, I am if you're asking.

995
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:17,189
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

996
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:20,108
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.

997
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:21,109
Yeah.

998
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:27,282
Don't forget you've got Steelers blood
running through your veins.

999
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:36,625
They sent Hugh to a speciaI schooI to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.

1000
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:38,919
So?

1001
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:41,588
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

1002
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,340
So?

1003
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:47,010
So I don't know how to dance
like that, Ethan.

1004
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:56,394
"MAKE IT WITH YOU")

1005
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,109
- No.
- Come on.

1006
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:05,654
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.

1007
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,115
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.

1008
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:11,576
Now, stand on my feet.

1009
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,580
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.

1010
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:17,374
OK.

1011
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:20,335
There and back.

1012
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,839
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.

1013
01:28:25,007 --> 01:28:28,760
Now get off.

1014
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,440
Would you wear this suit
tomorrow for me?

1015
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,152
Of course I would.

1016
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:09,592
Mom.

1017
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:17,892
Sweetie.

1018
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:24,566
You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.

1019
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,651
How are you feeling?

1020
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:29,988
Remember when I'd bring Zooey
to school in the first grade?

1021
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:31,990
She had that stuffed rabbit.

1022
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:33,450
Lamby the lamb.

1023
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,245
Right, Lamby the lamb.

1024
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:41,249
I remember the day
she never took him to school again.

1025
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:46,629
My stomach hurt that day.
That's how I feel now.

1026
01:29:46,797 --> 01:29:49,632
Like you lost something.
- Yeah.

1027
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,261
- Have you told her yet?
- No.

1028
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:59,100
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.

1029
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:02,020
Just tell her you love her.

1030
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,272
She knows.

1031
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,901
She needs to hear it from you.

1032
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:12,155
Of course I love her.
I mean, I love her the same way...

1033
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,825
...the same way I love you.

1034
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:10,130
Good morning.

1035
01:31:10,297 --> 01:31:11,506
Oh, God.

1036
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:16,052
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.

1037
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,846
Good morning, parents.

1038
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:21,683
Wow, sweetheart.
What a good idea. Here.

1039
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,144
Bring that orange juice right here.

1040
01:31:24,311 --> 01:31:27,063
Sweetie, just put down the tray,
I'll meet you in the kitchen. OK?

1041
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,399
Come on,
I squeezed the oranges all by myself.

1042
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:30,608
Now, please.

1043
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,488
What's wrong, Mom?
You're acting really weird.

1044
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:39,325
Nothing, sweetie. Just go finish getting
dressed and I'll take you to schooI.

1045
01:31:39,493 --> 01:31:41,953
Come on, let' go. Go.

1046
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,538
Love you, Mom.

1047
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:45,206
I love you, sweetie.

1048
01:31:47,751 --> 01:31:50,503
What's wrong with her seeing us?

1049
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,714
Really.

1050
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,469
What happens when you're gone?

1051
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,354
Yeah?

1052
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:10,690
The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.

1053
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,277
All right.

1054
01:32:18,782 --> 01:32:23,036
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

1055
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:06,329
- Hello.
You spotted me.

1056
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:09,457
- I'd have to be blind not to.
- Don't do anything stupid, Mitat.

1057
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,501
Your girls are expecting you
home tonight.

1058
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:13,836
So is your beautiful wife.

1059
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:17,715
Who were you talking to?

1060
01:33:37,861 --> 01:33:38,903
Come on, accelerate!

1061
01:33:45,244 --> 01:33:46,327
Come on!

1062
01:34:03,387 --> 01:34:04,637
Come on, faster!

1063
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,791
Have we lost him?

1064
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:24,133
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.

1065
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,755
Why you don't kill me already?

1066
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:08,010
Because you're the father who knows best.

1067
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:18,849
Just kill him!

1068
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:48,212
Vivi...

1069
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:29,211
Welcome back.

1070
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,310
You let the Wolf
slip through your hands again.

1071
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:46,854
Where am I?

1072
01:39:47,814 --> 01:39:49,148
A safe place.

1073
01:39:52,027 --> 01:39:54,528
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.

1074
01:39:54,696 --> 01:39:58,366
I was actually pretty curious myself.
And as it turns out,

1075
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:01,577
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.

1076
01:40:09,544 --> 01:40:12,129
It's my wife. Hello?

1077
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:14,173
Hi. Where are you?

1078
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:15,508
Um...

1079
01:40:16,635 --> 01:40:18,219
I'm leaving the doctor's office now.

1080
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:21,889
Hurry up and get home.
We're gonna be late for Zooey's party.

1081
01:40:22,057 --> 01:40:23,516
OK.

1082
01:40:26,228 --> 01:40:30,439
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
killing for you, Vivi.

1083
01:40:30,607 --> 01:40:32,400
You're almost there, Ethan.

1084
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:35,695
Kill the Wolf.

1085
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,449
I'm gonna need a new suit.

1086
01:40:43,268 --> 01:40:44,935
You heard him.

1087
01:40:51,902 --> 01:40:55,821
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.

1088
01:40:55,989 --> 01:40:58,491
Take me to my partner's house.

1089
01:40:58,659 --> 01:41:00,826
He will help me to get out of Paris.

1090
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:06,666
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?

1091
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:08,709
No!

1092
01:41:10,003 --> 01:41:12,588
Listen, just at least try them on?
No!

1093
01:41:21,223 --> 01:41:22,223
Whoa!

1094
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:29,480
Just smile and have fun.

1095
01:41:29,648 --> 01:41:33,150
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

1096
01:41:39,574 --> 01:41:41,409
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.

1097
01:41:51,628 --> 01:41:53,963
- Zoe.
- Hugh.

1098
01:41:54,131 --> 01:41:56,173
- You look great.
- Really, I do?

1099
01:41:56,341 --> 01:41:57,383
Yeah, of course.

1100
01:42:00,053 --> 01:42:02,680
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,

1101
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:04,200
these are my parents.

1102
01:42:04,367 --> 01:42:06,368
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.

1103
01:42:06,536 --> 01:42:08,037
You're welcome.

1104
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:10,080
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.

1105
01:42:10,248 --> 01:42:12,249
Hi. And this is my partner.

1106
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:18,214
Pleasure to meet you.

1107
01:42:21,092 --> 01:42:22,259
And you.

1108
01:42:23,094 --> 01:42:25,638
If it wasn't for this party,
we might never have met.

1109
01:42:29,267 --> 01:42:30,267
How do you do?

1110
01:42:32,604 --> 01:42:34,271
Enchanté.

1111
01:42:37,567 --> 01:42:38,484
Wow.

1112
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:39,860
Yeah, wow.

1113
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:42,446
Kids.

1114
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,256
Wow.

1115
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,467
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

1116
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,148
Isn't this great?

1117
01:43:18,316 --> 01:43:19,567
Yeah.

1118
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:22,945
Zooey, do me a favor.

1119
01:43:24,114 --> 01:43:26,323
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.

1120
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:37,585
Cheers.

1121
01:43:52,058 --> 01:43:53,475
You're working again!

1122
01:43:55,353 --> 01:43:58,355
Yeah. There's a problem here.

1123
01:44:00,483 --> 01:44:03,235
That's why you came back to Paris?

1124
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:06,697
No. I came back to see you and Zooey.

1125
01:44:06,865 --> 01:44:08,490
It was all a lie.

1126
01:44:08,658 --> 01:44:10,951
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.

1127
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:14,163
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

1128
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,498
Right now I don't
have the time to explain.

1129
01:44:36,478 --> 01:44:38,979
How many guys do we have?

1130
01:44:42,817 --> 01:44:45,611
The police will be here
in ten minutes.

1131
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:47,821
- You all right?
- No.

1132
01:44:47,989 --> 01:44:50,950
No, I'm not so good.
I've gotta go...

1133
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,787
Ifwe go now, there is enough time.

1134
01:44:57,999 --> 01:45:01,001
OK. This party's over.

1135
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,466
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.

1136
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:09,551
I'll get my funds, bring everyone in.

1137
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:11,679
Make sure the street's blocked.

1138
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:15,265
At least have the decency
to look at me.

1139
01:45:25,568 --> 01:45:26,735
Kill him.

1140
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:29,613
It's just bad luck.

1141
01:45:31,157 --> 01:45:32,324
You're sick, Ethan.

1142
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:43,502
Wow, this is unbelievable.

1143
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,713
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.

1144
01:45:55,765 --> 01:45:57,182
I'm gonna be sick.

1145
01:45:58,184 --> 01:45:59,768
Come with me.

1146
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:18,871
Did you scratch yourself?

1147
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:24,626
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.

1148
01:46:24,794 --> 01:46:25,836
Just leave it to someone else.

1149
01:46:27,922 --> 01:46:29,923
Just please stay here.

1150
01:46:43,271 --> 01:46:44,480
- Zooey!
- What?

1151
01:46:44,647 --> 01:46:45,773
Get down!

1152
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:18,055
You hear me in there?

1153
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:20,891
I'm sending you down.

1154
01:48:32,964 --> 01:48:34,381
Oh, shit.

1155
01:48:43,141 --> 01:48:44,224
WheeI's turning.

1156
01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:50,606
No, stay, you fuckers!

1157
01:48:50,773 --> 01:48:52,691
Don't!

1158
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,665
I gotta...

1159
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:11,293
Don't.

1160
01:49:12,211 --> 01:49:13,879
I wouldn't mind killing you.

1161
01:49:16,799 --> 01:49:18,800
You scared a lot of people up there.

1162
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:23,639
This is my daughter's party.

1163
01:49:35,068 --> 01:49:36,401
Yes.

1164
01:49:40,615 --> 01:49:41,490
Yes, come on.

1165
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:56,213
Viv.

1166
01:49:59,008 --> 01:50:00,801
Oh, my God.

1167
01:50:04,055 --> 01:50:06,306
Am I in hell?

1168
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:09,476
So that's what it looks like
to you, Ethan.

1169
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:12,813
Figures.

1170
01:50:14,649 --> 01:50:17,401
- Finish it.
- What?

1171
01:50:20,071 --> 01:50:22,406
You'll do what I tell you to.

1172
01:50:22,573 --> 01:50:25,742
- No.
- Finish it.

1173
01:50:26,661 --> 01:50:29,496
I passed my quota, Vivi.

1174
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:31,665
Ethan...

1175
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:34,876
Jesus Christ!

1176
01:50:42,844 --> 01:50:45,262
Are you really done working for them?

1177
01:50:45,888 --> 01:50:48,515
A killer is a killer.
He'll never change.

1178
01:50:48,683 --> 01:50:50,475
I know I haven't done right by you and Zooey.

1179
01:50:50,643 --> 01:50:52,394
Kill him.

1180
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:53,937
I should've left a long time ago.

1181
01:50:54,105 --> 01:50:56,231
- What about your daughter?
- I wasn't there.

1182
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:58,900
Do it.

1183
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:03,697
What kind of kid
doesn't know how to ride a bike?

1184
01:51:03,865 --> 01:51:06,450
The kind of kid who never had
a father to teach her.

1185
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:09,745
- Ethan.
- Ethan!

1186
01:51:11,289 --> 01:51:12,414
Do it!

1187
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:14,082
Promise you'll never
lie to me again.

1188
01:51:15,376 --> 01:51:16,418
You have no choice.

1189
01:51:19,505 --> 01:51:21,423
I don't think so.

1190
01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:27,846
The wife wants me to give it up.

1191
01:52:07,345 --> 01:52:08,595
Can I talk to her?

1192
01:52:08,763 --> 01:52:11,556
No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.

1193
01:52:11,724 --> 01:52:14,101
What?
Yeah, we're...

1194
01:52:14,268 --> 01:52:15,936
We're taking a break
from each other right now.

1195
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:18,146
At least she's not throwing them at me.

1196
01:52:18,314 --> 01:52:20,398
Is everything all right?

1197
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:24,653
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.

1198
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:26,905
She said things, I've said things.

1199
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:29,491
There's been some tears,

1200
01:52:29,659 --> 01:52:31,701
but the week overall's
been really worth it.

1201
01:53:05,236 --> 01:53:06,236
Hey.

1202
01:53:07,697 --> 01:53:09,906
These are some presents
from me and, um...

1203
01:53:10,074 --> 01:53:12,242
...a package that was
dropped at the house.

1204
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:15,287
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?

1205
01:53:21,252 --> 01:53:23,003
I love you, Tina.

1206
01:53:25,506 --> 01:53:27,299
Just not enough to quit.

1207
01:53:28,342 --> 01:53:31,761
I think you're wrong,
but I understand.

1208
01:53:34,473 --> 01:53:39,978
If I could say one word to you
to change your mind,

1209
01:53:40,146 --> 01:53:42,189
would you give me that chance?

1210
01:53:42,356 --> 01:53:43,815
This isn't a game.

1211
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:47,777
We don't have to stay in the same room,
we don't have to sleep together,

1212
01:53:47,945 --> 01:53:49,946
that's not what I'm asking.

1213
01:53:50,114 --> 01:53:53,617
If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.

1214
01:53:53,784 --> 01:53:55,452
I'll hear the music, and then I'll know.

1215
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:57,287
And if I never hear it...

1216
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:00,916
I've already gotten more than I deserve.

1217
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:08,715
I just wanna hang out as long as I can
with my daughter and my wife.

1218
01:54:10,843 --> 01:54:13,637
- What's the word?
- What?

1219
01:54:13,804 --> 01:54:15,305
What's the one word
to make me change my mind?

1220
01:54:15,473 --> 01:54:19,559
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1221
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:24,147
That's two, Ethan.

1222
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:26,608
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1223
01:54:26,776 --> 01:54:27,984
I'm so glad you came!

1224
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:32,989
Come on, let's go inside.

1225
01:54:34,116 --> 01:54:35,825
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1226
01:54:40,748 --> 01:54:41,831
Come on.

1227
01:54:55,763 --> 01:54:58,723
"SWEET DISPOSITION")

1228
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,437
Is Dad a badass?

1229
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,277
Well, he's, um...
He's done some things.

1230
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:19,244
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1231
01:55:19,412 --> 01:55:20,912
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1232
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:25,041
He loves you so much.
